<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">1</a></span></p>

<p>Carlo Zeno, gentleman of Venice, ex-clerk, ex-gambler,
ex-soldier of fortune, ex-lay prebendary of Patras, ex-duellist,
and ex-Greek general, being about twenty-nine
years of age, and having in his tough body the scars of
half-a-dozen wounds that would have killed an ordinary
man, had resolved to turn over a new leaf, had become
a merchant, and was established in Constantinople in
the year 1376.</p>

<p>He had bought a house in the city itself because the
merchants of Genoa all dwelt in the town of Pera, on the
other side of the Golden Horn. A Venetian could not
have lived in the same place with Genoese, for the air
would have poisoned him, to a certainty; and besides,
the sight of a Genoese face, the sound of the Genoese
dialect, the smell of Genoese cookery, were all equally
sickening to any one brought up in the lagoons. Genoa
was not fit to be mentioned within hearing of polite
Venetian ears, its very name was unspeakable by decent
Venetian lips; and even to pronounce the syllables for
purposes of business was horribly unlucky.</p>

<p>Therefore Carlo Zeno and his friends had taken up their
abode in the old city, amongst the Greeks and the
Bokharians, the Jews and the Circassians, and they left
the Genoese to themselves in Pera, pretending that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
did not even exist. It was not always easy to keep up
the pretence, it is true, for Zeno had extremely good eyes
and could not help seeing those abominations of mankind
on the other side of the Golden Horn when he sat in
his balcony on spring evenings; and his only consolation
was to dream of destroying them wholesale, of hewing
them in pieces by the hundred and the thousand, and
of piling up pyramids of their ugly grinning heads.
Why were they Genoese? Carlo Zeno would rather
have taken a box on the ear from Sultan Amurad, the
Turk, over there in Asia Minor, than a civil word from
the least objectionable of those utterly unspeakable
monsters of Genoese. 'Behold,' said Tertullian one
day in scorn, 'how these Christians love one another.'
Matters had not improved in eleven hundred years,
since that learned Doctor of the Church had departed
this life, presumably for a more charitable world; but
Carlo Zeno would have answered that the Genoese were
no more Christians than mules, and much less so than
the pigs, which are all under the special protection of
the blessed Saint Anthony.</p>

<p>At the very time, too, when my story begins, those
obnoxious villains of Genoa were on the successful side
of a revolution; for they had helped Emperor Andronicus
to imprison his father, Emperor John, in the tall
Amena tower on the north side of the city, by the Golden
Horn, and to lock up his two younger brothers in a separate
dungeon. It was true that Emperor John had ordered
Andronicus and his little son of five to be blinded with
boiling vinegar, but Genoese money had miraculously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
converted the vinegar into bland white wine, and had
reduced the temperature from the boiling point to that
of a healthful lotion, so that neither the boy nor the man
were any the worse after the application than before; but
Andronicus had resented the mere intention on the part
of his father, and had avenged himself by taking the
Empire, such as it was, for the present, while reserving
the delight of murdering his parent and his brothers at a
convenient season in the future.</p>

<p>All this was very well, no doubt, and Andronicus
was undisputed Emperor for the time being, because the
Genoese and Sultan Amurad were willing that he should
be; but Amurad had not always been his friend, and
the Genoese had not always had the upper hand of the
Venetians; the wind might change in a moment and a
tempest might whirl him away from the throne even
more quickly than the fair breeze had wafted him
towards it.</p>

<p>Zeno thought so too, and wondered whether it would
please fate to make him the spirit of the storm. He
cared very little about Handsome John, as Paleologus
was nicknamed, but he cared a great deal for a possible
chance of driving the Genoese out of Pera and of getting
the island of Tenedos for the Venetian Republic.</p>

<p>And now he had transacted the business of the day,
and had dined on a roasted palamit, for it was a Friday
and the palamit is the best fish that swims, from the
Dardanelles to the Black Sea; and Zeno would no more
have eaten meat on a day of abstinence than he would
have sat down to table with a Genoese. He had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
brought up to be a churchman, and though the attempt
to make a priest of him had failed for obvious reasons,
he was constant in observing those little rules and regulations
which he had been taught to believe conducive
to salvation, seeing that he was of a rash temper, prone
to seek danger, and never sure of coming home alive
when it pleased him to walk abroad. He was not a
quarrelsome man on his own account, but he had a most
wonderful facility for taking up the quarrels of other
people who seemed to be in the right. The more hopeless
the just case, or cause, the more certain it was that
Carlo Zeno would take it up and fight for it as if it were
his own.</p>

<p>But now, if ever, he was peacefully inclined; for the
palamit had been done to a turn by the Dalmatian cook;
the salad which had followed it had been composed to his
liking, with shredded red peppers, pickled olives, anchovies,
and cardamom seeds, all mixed among the crisp
lettuce; and the draught of wine that had finished the
meal had gleamed in the Murano glass like spirit of gold,
and the flavour of it, as he had thoughtfully sipped it,
had made him think of the scent that still sunshine
draws from fruit hanging on vine and tree. He sat in a
deep chair on his covered balcony, and was conscious
that for the moment peace and privacy were almost as
delightful as the best fight in the world. It would have
been impossible to say more than that.</p>

<p>The sun was low, for the spring days were not yet
long, and the shadow of the city already fell across the
deep blue water of the Golden Horn. Zeno gazed down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
at the moving scene; his keen brown eyes watched the
boats gliding by and softened, for what he saw made him
think of Venice, the lagoons, and his home. Of all
people, the most incorrigible wanderer is generally the
most hopelessly sentimental about his native place.</p>

<p>Zeno had brown eyes that could soften like a woman's,
but they were much more often keen and quick, turning
suddenly to take in at a glance all that could be seen at
all, until they fixed themselves with a piercing gaze on
whatever interested their owner most for the time being,&mdash;his
friend, or his adversary, his quarry if he were
hunting, a woman's face or figure. He was not a big
man, but he was thoroughly well made and well put
together, elastic, tough, and active. His small brown
hands, compact and firm, seemed ready to seize or strike
at instant notice&mdash;the ideal hands of a fighting man.
There was the same ready and fearless look in his clean-shaven
face and small, energetic head, and when he
moved his least motion betrayed the same gifts. Women
did not think him handsome in those days, when the
idea of beauty in man or woman alike was associated with
fair or auburn hair and milk-white skin and cherry lips.
In fact, Carlo Zeno hardly showed his lips at all, his
thick hair was almost black, and his complexion was
already as tanned and weather-stained as an old sailor's.
But like many men of action he was careful of his dress,
and extremely fastidious in his ways. In the ranks, the
greatest dandies are often the best soldiers, explain the
fact as you will. Some officers say that such men are far
too vain to run away. Many a French noble who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
perished on the scaffold in the revolution bestowed more
of his last moments on his toilet than he devoted to
his prayers, and died like a hero and a gentleman.
There are defects, like vanity, which may sometimes
pass for virtues. Carlo Zeno was one of those men whose
outward appearance is little affected by what they do,
on whom the dust and heat of travel seem to leave no
trace; who are invariably clean, neat, and fresh, the
envy and despair of ordinary people. His dark-red
velvet cap was always set on his thick hair at the same
angle, and its sheen was as speckless as if dust did not
exist. The narrow miniver border of his wine-coloured
cloth coat was never ragged or worn at the edges; the
fine linen, gathered at his throat and wrists, never betrayed
the least suspicion of dinginess; the mud of
Constantinople never clung to the soft Bulgarian leather
of his well-made shoes.</p>

<p>Just now, the latter were stuck out in front of him
as he leaned back in his deep chair and stretched his
legs, asking himself vaguely whether he could be contented
for any long time with the quiet life he was leading.</p>

<p>As if in answer to the question, his clerk and secretary,
an important little grey-bearded personage, appeared
on the balcony at that very moment with a letter in his
hand.</p>

<p>'From Venice, sir,' said Omobono&mdash;that was his
name&mdash;'and by the handwriting and the seal I judge
it is written by Messer Marco Pesaro.'</p>

<p>Zeno frowned and then smiled, as he generally did at
the manifestations of Omobono's incorrigible curiosity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
It was the only defect of a most excellent person who was
indispensable to Zeno's daily life, and invaluable in his
business. Omobono had the sad and gentle face of an
honest man who has failed on his own account, but whose
excellent qualities are immensely serviceable to stronger
men.</p>

<p>Zeno took the letter and glanced towards the harbour,
far to the right of his house. Omobono made a
short step backwards, but kept his eyes fixed on the
paper.</p>

<p>'No foreign vessel has anchored to-day,' said the merchant;
'who brought this?'</p>

<p>'The captain of a Venetian ship, sir, which is anchored
outside, before the Port of Theodosius.'</p>

<p>Zeno nodded carelessly as he cut the string. The
letter was written on strong cotton paper from Padua,
folded six times and secured by twisted hemp threads,
of which the final knot had been squeezed into red wax
and flattened under a heavy seal. Omobono watched
his employer quietly, hoping to learn that he had rightly
guessed the correspondent's name. Zeno, intent on
reading, paid no attention to the secretary, who gradually
edged nearer until he could almost make out the
words.</p>

<p>This was what Zeno read, in very long sentences and
in the Venetian dialect:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Most Beloved and Honoured Friend</span>&mdash;I despatch
this writing by the opportunity of Sebastian Cornèr's
good ship, sailing to-morrow, with the help of God, for
Constantinople with a cargo of Florence cloth, Dalmatian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
linen, crossbows, Venetian lace, straw hats, and blind
nightingales. May the Lord preserve the vessel, the
crew, and the cargo from those unmentionable dogs of
Genoese, and bring all safely to the end of the voyage
within two months. The cloth, lace, and straw hats
are mine, the rest of the cargo belongs to Sebastian
Cornèr, except the nightingales, which are a gift from
the Most Serene Republic to his majesty the Emperor,
together with the man who takes care of the birds.
What I say of my share in the cargo, most noble friend,
is not as in the way of boasting myself a wealthy merchant,
for indeed I am by no means rich, though by my
constant industry, my sleepless watchfulness, and my
honest dealing I have saved a crust of bread. Nay,
I say it rather because I come with a request to you, and
in order that you may know that there will be money
due to me in Constantinople for the sale of this cargo,
through the house of Marin Cornèr, the brother of Sebastian,
who will pay you on your demand, most beloved
and honoured friend, the sum of three hundred gold
ducats. For I feel sure that you will undertake the
business I ask, for love of me and a commission of a lira
of piccoli for each ducat. I desire, in fact, that you will
buy for me the most handsome slave that can be had for
the money I offer, or even, if the girl were surpassingly
beautiful, for three hundred and fifty ducats. The truth
is, most noble friend, that my wife, who is, as you know,
ten years older than I, and impeded by rheumatisms,
is in need of a youthful and accomplished companion to
help her to pass the time, and as I have always made it
my duty and my business to fulfil and even, as in the
present case, to anticipate her wishes, I am willing to
spend this large sum of money for the sole purpose of
pleasing her. Moreover I turn to you, most dear sir
and friend, well knowing that your kindness is only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
matched by your fine taste. My wife would, I am sure,
prefer as a companion a girl with fine natural hair,
either quite black or very fair, the red auburn colour
being so common here as to make one almost wish that
women would not dye their hair at all. My dear and
honoured friend, the teeth are a very important matter;
pray give your most particular attention to their whiteness
and regularity, for my wife is very fastidious. And
also, I entreat you, choose a slave with small ankles, not
larger than you can span with your thumb and middle
finger. My wife will care less about a very small waist,
though if it be naturally slender it is certainly a point of
beauty. In all this, dearest sir, employ for love of me
those gifts of discernment with which heaven has so
richly endowed you, and I trust you will consider the
commission a fair one. Sebastian Cornèr, who is an old
man, will take charge of the slave and bring her to
Venice, if you will only see that she is properly protected
and fed until he is ready to sail, and this at the usual
rate. I have also agreed with him that she is not to be
lodged in the common cabin with the other female
slaves whom he will bring from the Black Sea on his
own account, but separately and with better food, lest
she should grow unpleasingly thin. Yet it is understood
that his regular slave-master is to be responsible for
her protection, and will watch over her behaviour during
the voyage. This, my most worthy, dear and honourable
sir and friend, is the commission which I beg you to
undertake; and in this and all your other affairs I pray
that the hand of Providence, the intercession of the
saints, and the wisdom of the one hundred and eighteen
Nicene fathers may be always with you. From Venice.
Marco Pesaro to the most noble patrician, Carlo Zeno,
his friend. The fourteenth day of March in the year
1376.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>Zeno smiled repeatedly as he read the letter, but he
did not look up till he had finished it. His eyes met
those of his secretary, who was now much nearer than
before.</p>

<p>'Omobono,' said Zeno gravely, 'curiosity is unbecoming
in a man of your years. With your grey beard and
solemn air you are as prying and curious as a girl.'</p>

<p>Omobono looked contritely at his folded hands and
moved the left one slowly within the right.</p>

<p>'Alas, sir,' he answered, 'I know it. I would that
these hands held but a thousandth part of what my
eyes have seen.'</p>

<p>'They would be rich if they did,' observed Zeno
bluntly. 'It is fortunate that with your uncommon
taste for other men's affairs you can at least keep something
to yourself. Since you have no doubt mastered
the contents of this letter as well as I&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The good man protested.</p>

<p>'Indeed, sir, how could I have read a single word at this
distance? Try for yourself, sir, for your eyes are far
younger and better than mine.'</p>

<p>'Younger,' answered Zeno, 'but hardly better. And
now send for Barlaam, the Syrian merchant, and bid him
come quickly, for he may do business with me before
the sun sets.'</p>

<p>'He will not do business to-day,' answered Omobono.
'This is Friday, which the Muslemin keep holy.'</p>

<p>'So much the worse for Barlaam. He will miss a good
bargain. Send for Abraham of Smyrna, the Jewish
caravan-broker.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>'He will not do business either,' said Omobono, 'for
to-morrow is Sabbath, and Shabbes begins on Friday
evening.'</p>

<p>'In the name of the blessed Mark our Evangelist, then
send me some Christian, for Sunday cannot begin on
Friday, even in Constantinople.'</p>

<p>'There is Rustan Karaboghazji, the Bokharian,' suggested
Omobono.</p>

<p>Zeno looked sharply at the secretary.</p>

<p>'The slave-dealer?' he enquired.</p>

<p>Omobono nodded, but he reddened a little, poor man,
and looked down at his hands again, for he had betrayed
himself, after protesting that he knew nothing of the
contents of the letter. Zeno laughed gaily.</p>

<p>'You are a good man, Omobono,' he said. 'You could
not deceive a child. Do you happen to have heard that
Rustan has what Messer Marco wants?'</p>

<p>But Omobono shook his head and grew still redder.</p>

<p>'Indeed, sir,&mdash;I&mdash;I do not know what your friend
wants&mdash;I only guessed&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'A very good guess, Omobono. If I could guess the
future as you can the present, I should be a rich man.
Yes, send for Rustan. I believe he will do better for
me than the Jew or the Mohammedan.'</p>

<p>'They say here that it takes ten Jews to cheat a Greek,
and ten Greeks to cheat a Bokharian, sir,' said Omobono.</p>

<p>'To say nothing of those Genoese swine who cheat the
whole Eastern Empire! What chance have we poor
Venetians in such a place?'</p>

<p>'May heaven send the Genoese the fate of Sodom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
and Gomorrah, and the halter of Judas Iscariot!' prayed
Omobono very devoutly.</p>

<p>'By all means,' returned Zeno, 'I hope so. Now send
for the Bokharian.'</p>

<p>Omobono bowed and left the balcony, and his employer
leaned back in his chair again, still holding the folded
paper in his hand. His expressive face wore a look of
amusement for a while, but presently it turned into
something more like good-natured contempt, as his
thoughts went back from his secretary's last speech, to
Marco Pesaro and his letter.</p>

<p>This Pesaro was a fat little man of forty, who had
married a rich widow ten years older than himself.
Carlo Zeno had known him well before he had been
married, a boon companion, a jolly good-for-nothing
who loved the society of younger men, and did them no
good by example or precept. His father and mother
had both perished in the great plague that raged in the
year when Zeno was born, and Marco had been brought
up by two old aunts who doted on him. The result
usual in such cases had followed in due time; he had
spent his own fortune and what he inherited from his
aunts, who died conveniently, and when near forty he
had found himself penniless, a poor relation of a great
family, none the worse in health for nearly a quarter of
a century of gaiety and feasting, and in temper much inclined
to lead the same life for at least another twenty
years. The heart was young yet, the round, pink
face was absurdly youthful still, but the purse was in a
state of permanent collapse, without any prospect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
of recovery. Then Marco sold everything he had,
down to the sword which he had never drawn, and the
jewelled dagger which had never done any worse damage
than to cut the string of a love-letter; he sold his last
silver spoons, his silver drinking-cup and the gold chain
and ball from his cloak, and with the proceeds he gave
a dozen of his friends one last farewell feast. Then, on
the following day, his spirit broken and resigned to his
fate, he offered himself to the very rich, elderly, and devout
widow who had been making eyes at him for six
months, and he was promptly accepted. With some
of her money he engaged in the Eastern trade, renounced
the follies of his youth, and became a respectable merchant.</p>

<p>It was affluence, it was luxury, but it was slavery
and he knew it, and accepted the fact at first with much
philosophy. Surely, he said to himself, a good cook and
a good cellar, with a fine house at San Cassian, and a
virtuous, if elderly, wife ought to satisfy any man of forty.
The rest was but vanity. Could anything be more
absurd, at his age, than to go on for ever playing the
butterfly&mdash;such an elderly butterfly!&mdash;from one pair
of bright eyes to another?</p>

<p>But he had counted without the fact that the butterfly
is the final development of its genus and cannot turn
into anything else. It must be a butterfly to the end.
Poor Marco soon found that his heart was as susceptible
as ever, and could beat like a boy's on very slight
provocation, but that unfortunately it was never his rich
wife who provoked it to such unseemly and lively action.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
Yet her facial angle inspired him with a terror even
greater than the attraction of a pretty face and a well-turned
figure. She had a way of setting her thin lips
over her prominent teeth which at the same time
stretched the skin upon the bridge of her hooked nose
while she looked at him from under her half-closed lids,
that made his blood run cold, robbed the richest sauce
of its delicious flavour, and turned the wine of Samos to
vinegar in his glass. Daily, she grew older, sharper,
more irritable; and daily, too, the heart of Marco
Pesaro seemed to grow younger and the more to crave
the companionship of a mate much younger still, or at
least the near presence of those outward, visible, and
tangible gifts of the gods, such as a deep warm eye, and
a soft white hand, with which man has always associated
the heart of woman.</p>

<p>Zeno guessed all this and the rest too; the letter he had
received needed no further explanation, and for old
acquaintance's sake he had no objection to executing
the commission Marco had thrust upon him.</p>

<p>And now, all you who stop and gather round the story-teller
in this world's great bazaar, to listen, if his tale
please you, and to find fault with him if it does not, you
cry out that if Carlo Zeno was really the hero history
describes him to have been, he would have been very,
very grieved at being asked to do anything so inhuman as
to buy a pretty slave abroad to be sent home to a friend,
even though the latter protested that the girl was to
be trained as a companion for his wife. He would have
been grieved and angry, he would have torn the letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
to shreds, and would either not have answered it at all,
or would have written to tell Pesaro that he was a brute,
that men and women are all free and equal, and that to
buy and sell them is high treason against the majesty
of the rights of men.</p>

<p>But to those protests and outcries the story-teller
has many answers ready. In the first place, no one had
even dreamt of the rights of men in 1376; and secondly,
the trade in white slaves was almost as profitable to
Venice then as it is in 1906 to certain great states the
story-teller could name, with the advantage that there
was no hypocritical secret about it, and that it was provided
for in international treaties, in spite of the Pope,
who said it was wrong; and thirdly, heroes are heroes
for ever in respect of their heroic deeds, but in their
daily lives they are very much like the other men of their
class and time, as you will soon learn if you read the
life of Bayard, 'without fear or reproach,' written by his
Faithful Servitor; for the faithful one set down some
doings of the virtuous knight which a modern biographer
would have altogether left out, but which were no more
a 'reproach' to a man in the year 1500, than getting
drunk was a 'reproach' in 1700, or than stealing anything
over a million is a 'reproach' to-day; fourthly and lastly,
if Zeno had virtuously refused to buy a slave for Marco
Pesaro, there would have been no story to tell, and this
seems an excellent argument to the story-teller himself.</p>

<p>Zeno's thoughts soon wandered from Pesaro and the
letter, and followed the old thread of life in Venice, till
it led his soul through the labyrinth of daily existence far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
out into the dreamland beyond; and the place of his
dreams was a calm and resplendent water, where stately
palaces rose through vapours of purple and gold against
an evening sky. Over the lagoon came music of old
chimes from San Giorgio, and the deeper bells of Venice
answered back again; at the instant the sunset breeze
floated off the land and breathed into the dyed sails
of the Istrians without a sound, so that the boats began
to move by magic, gliding out one by one with a soft,
low rush, heard only for a moment, as of a woman's
hand drawn across silk.</p>

<p>The mere thought of Venice called up the vision of her
before the inward eye of his heart; for he loved his
native city better than he had ever loved any woman yet,
and much better than his own life. When he could think
of Venice, until the broad expanse of the lagoon seemed
to spread itself over the deeper and darker waters of the
Golden Horn, and when he could fancy himself at home,
he was supremely and calmly happy, and would not
have changed his dream for any reality except its own.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p>Omobono had drawn on a pair of well-greased raw-hide
boots that came half-way up his thin legs, and had
wrapped himself in his big brown cloak before going out.
On his smooth grey head he wore a soft felt hat, the brim
turned up round the crown at the back but pulled out to
a long point in front, and he carried a tough cornel stick
in his right hand. He had been careful to leave in the
strong box the purse that contained money belonging
to his employer, and had but a few small coins of his
own in his wallet to pay a ferryman if he should need one,
or to give to a hungry beggar. Like most men who have
failed to make money Omobono was very sorry for poor
people, and did not believe that all beggars could be rich
if they would work. But he was poor himself, and his
charity was of the humble kind.</p>

<p>There was a fairly broad street behind Carlo Zeno's
house, and here the early spring sun had dried the mud
to something like a solid surface; but Omobono followed
this thoroughfare only for a little distance, and
then turned into a narrow and filthy lane that led to
other lanes, and to others still beyond, all crowded with
humanity, all dark and muddy, all foul with garbage,
all reeking with the overpowering smell of Eastern cooking
made up of garlic, frying onions, sour cream, oil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of sesame, and roasting mutton where there were Jews or
Mohammedans, or fried fish where Christians lived, since
it was Friday.</p>

<p>The small wooden houses, black with smoke and the
dampness of the past winter, overhung the way so that
the opposite balconies of the second stories almost
touched each other. Had the buildings been higher,
scarcely any light at all would have reached the lower
windows; as it was, a man with good eyes might just
see to read at noon if he were not too far within.</p>

<p>Omobono evidently knew his way well enough, for
he did not pause as he threaded the labyrinth, and only
now and then glanced up at certain dingy signs that hung
from the crazy wooden balconies, or from wooden arms
that stuck out here and there like gallows from the walls.
As he walked, he was chiefly occupied in not running
against the people he met, and in not stepping upon the
half-naked children that squirmed and squalled in the
mud before every doorstep. For there were children
everywhere, children and dirt, dirt and children, all of
much the same colour in those dusky lanes. Near almost
every open door the slatternly mother stirred a dark mess
of some sort over a little earthen pan of coals, or toasted
gobbets of fat mutton on a black iron fork, or fried some
wretched fish in boiling oil. The Christian women were
by far the dirtiest, and their children were the least
healthy and the most neglected, for many of the little
creatures had not a stitch of clothing on them. Most
decent were the Mohammedans; they had already the
bearing and the self-respect of the conquering race, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
they treated their Greek and Bokharian neighbours
with silent contempt. Did not Sultan Amurad, over
there on the Asian shore, make and unmake these miserable
little Greek emperors as he pleased? If he chose
could he not take Constantinople and turn a stream of
Christian blood into the Golden Horn that would redden
the Sea of Marmora as far as Antigone and Prinkipo?</p>

<p>Omobono went on and on, picking his way as he might,
and little noticed by the people. He was not by any
means in the poorest quarter of the city, and no one
begged of him as he went by. If he thought of anything
except of not setting his booted foot down on some child's
sprawling leg or arm, he thanked heaven and the saints
that he had been born a Venetian, and had been washed
and sent to school like a Christian boy when he was little
instead of having first seen the light, or what passed for
light, in a back street of Constantinople.</p>

<p>He turned another corner, entered a lane even narrower
than those he had yet traversed, but almost
deserted, and much less dark because one side of it was
occupied by a wall not more than ten feet high, in which
only one small door was to be seen. Along the top of the
masonry all sorts of sharp bits of rusty iron and a quantity
of broken crockery were set in mortar with the evident
intention of discouraging any attempt to climb
over, either from within or from without. The door
itself was in good repair, and had been recently coated
with tar and sharp sand by way of preserving it against
the damp. A well-worn horizontal slit an inch long,
and an upright one a foot higher up, showed that it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
two separate Persian locks into which keys were often
thrust.</p>

<p>Omobono rapped on the tarred wood with the iron-shod
end of his stick and listened. He could hear a
number of girls' voices chattering, and one was singing
softly in a language he did not understand. He knocked
again, a moment later the voices were suddenly silent,
and he heard the clacking of heavy slippers on wet flags
as some one came to open.</p>

<p>'Who knocks?' asked a deep and harsh female voice
from within, in the Greek tongue but with a thick accent.</p>

<p>'A Venetian who has business with the worthy Karaboghazji,'
answered Omobono in a conciliatory tone.</p>

<p>'Which Karaboghazji?' enquired the voice suspiciously.</p>

<p>'Rustan,' explained Omobono mildly.</p>

<p>From his voice, the woman probably judged that if
he had come with any nefarious purpose she was more
than a match for him. The door opened after some
rattling and creaking of locks, and Omobono started
in spite of himself. She was indeed a match for him,
or for any other man who was likely to knock at the
door. It was no wonder that the Venetian secretary
drew back and hesitated before he spoke again.</p>

<p>The woman was a huge red-haired negress in yellow,
fully six feet tall in her heelless slippers, and her black
arms, bare above the elbow, were as sinewy and muscular
as any fisherman's or porter's. Her thick lips were
parted in a sort of savage grin that showed two rows of
teeth as sharp and white as a shark's; her hair must have
been just dyed that day, for it was as red as flame to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
very roots, and it stood out almost straight from her
shiny black forehead and temples; as she rather contemptuously
scrutinised Omobono from head to foot
the whites of her coal-black eyes gleamed in a way that
was positively terrifying. She wore wide Greek trousers
of blue cotton, gathered at the ankle, and a wadded
coat of yellow, that hung down below her knees in loose
folds, like a sort of skirt, but fitted tightly over her tremendous
shoulders. This garment was closely girded
round her ample waist by a red sash, in which she carried
her armoury, consisting of a serviceable Arab knife with
a bone hilt and brass sheath, and a small whip made of
a broad flat thong of hippopotamus hide with a short
oak stock.</p>

<p>This terrific apparition stood in the little vestibule
holding the door open and grinning at Omobono. She
had closed another door behind her before opening the
outer one, for the slave-dealer's establishment was evidently
managed with a view to the safety of his merchandise.</p>

<p>'And what do you want of Rustan Karaboghazji at
this time of the afternoon?' enquired the negress.
'Who are you?'</p>

<p>'I am only a clerk,' answered Omobono in a deprecating
tone, and shrinking a little under his cloak, as
the awful virago thrust her head forward. 'I am the
clerk of Messer Carlo Zeno, a rich Venetian merchant,
who sends a message by me to your master&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'My master!' interrupted the black woman, with a
scornful laugh. 'My master, indeed!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span></p>

<p>'I&mdash;I supposed&mdash;&mdash;' faltered Omobono apologetically.</p>

<p>The negress moved a little and rested one huge hand
on her hip, while she slipped the other slowly up the
door-post till it was above her head. In this attitude
she looked gigantic.</p>

<p>'You mean my husband,' she said, showing all her
teeth. 'Rustan Karaboghazji is my husband. Do you
understand?'</p>

<p>'Yes, Kokóna&mdash;I&mdash;I mean Kyría&mdash;yes, certainly!
I should have known at once that you were the mistress
of the house if you had not condescended to open the
door yourself, Kyría.'</p>

<p>'And what would become of the cattle,' enquired the
negress with a backward toss of her head towards the
yard behind her, 'if the stable door were in charge of a
slave? If your master&mdash;' she dwelt on the two words
contemptuously&mdash;'wishes to buy of us, he will have to
come here and choose for himself.'</p>

<p>'No, no!' answered Omobono hastily. 'It is another
matter. I think it is a commission for a friend. It is
something very especial. That is why I beg to be allowed
to speak with the Kyrios, your husband.'</p>

<p>The black woman had listened attentively.</p>

<p>'At this hour,' she said after a moment's thought,
'Rustan is at his devotions.'</p>

<p>'I would not interrupt them for the world,' protested
Omobono. 'I can wait&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No. You will probably find him at the church of
Saint Sergius and Saint Bacchus. If he is not there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
ask the sacristan where he is. My husband is a very
devout man; the sacristan knows him well.'</p>

<p>'I hope,' said Omobono, whose curiosity scented a
mystery, 'that the sacristan will not take me for an
importunate stranger and send me on a fool's errand.
If the Kyría would give me some sign by which the
sacristan may know that I came from her&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Omobono paused on this suggestion, hoping for a
favourable answer. Again the big woman waited a
moment before speaking.</p>

<p>'Ask the sacristan to direct you to find Rustan Karaboghazji,
by four toes and by five toes,' she said at
last. 'He will certainly tell you the truth if you ask
him in that way.'</p>

<p>'By four toes and by five toes,' repeated Omobono.
'I cannot forget that. I thank you, Kyría Karaboghazji,
and I wish you a good day.'</p>

<p>The negress nodded and showed her teeth but said
nothing more, drew back and shut the door without
waiting any longer. Omobono stood still a moment,
listened to the slapping of the heavy slippers on the wet
flags within, and then went away down the almost
deserted lane, wondering much at the taste of the Bokharian
merchant in marrying an African giantess.
But soon his natural curiosity began to occupy itself
more actively with the hidden meaning of the password
given him by Rustan's wife; and, meditating on this
problem, he made his way through the heart of the city,
traversing many narrow and tortuous streets, till he
suddenly emerged into a broad highway where marble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
buildings gleamed in the late afternoon sunshine, and
richly dressed Greeks lounged in the wide exedræ and
stately porticoes, discussing the affairs of the Empire in
general and their neighbours' most particularly.</p>

<p>Omobono trudged along, past the corner of the wide
Forum of Theodosius, once the centre of the city's
teeming life, but now given over to the tanners and
leather-dressers, for one end of it was used as a slaughterhouse
and the hides had not to be dragged far to be
cured; he walked on quickly, keeping to the left, and
was soon in narrow streets again, where afterwards the
Grand Bazaar was built, and where even in those days
the Persian merchants and the jewellers, the dealers in
fine carpets and Eastern merchandise, the perfumers, the
Egyptian goldsmiths and the Bokharian money-changers
had their homes and the headquarters of their business.
Here Omobono exchanged greetings now and then with
men of all nationalities except Genoese, and very few
of these last were to be seen, for they kept to their own
quarter beyond the Golden Horn, in Pera. But Omobono
would not stop to talk, and the streets were clean
here, and well kept, and the children were not to be seen,
so that he could walk quickly, without picking his way.</p>

<p>On still, and farther on; through the almost classic
Forum of Constantine, past the hill on which the
bronze-bound porphyry column still stands, and down
on the other side, keeping the Hippodrome on his left
and diving into the Bokharian quarter, as different from
the last through which he had come, as that had been
from those he had passed before. For then, as now,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Constantinople was a patchwork of divers nations and
languages and customs, and their quarters were like
distinct towns,&mdash;some filthy, noisy and unhealthy,
some rich and stately, some quiet and poor, some asleep
all day and riotous all night, others silent as sleep itself
from nightfall till dawn, and noisy all day with the hum
of business or the ceaseless hammering clang and clatter
of workmen's tools.</p>

<p>Before Omobono emerged upon the little square which
then surrounded the churches of Saints Sergius and
Bacchus and of Saints Peter and Paul&mdash;the latter is
now destroyed&mdash;he heartily wished that he had hired
a horse and man at one of the street corners; but he
forgot his weariness when his destination was reached,
and he saw a little bandy-legged sacristan in an absurdly
short cassock of shabby black and purple cloth, leaning
against one of the columns of the portico.</p>

<p>Omobono ascended the broad steps that led up
from the level of the street, as though he were going
in, but just as he was close to the sacristan he stopped,
as if without any premeditation, and made a gesture of
salutation, smiling in a friendly way.</p>

<p>'Praised be our Lord,' he said, in the Greek manner.</p>

<p>'Our Lord be praised. Amen,' answered the sacristan
indifferently, for it was the custom to do so.</p>

<p>'Could you inform me,' proceeded the Venetian clerk,
'whether that good man Kyrios Rustan Karaboghazji
is now in the church at his devotions?'</p>

<p>The sacristan had a perfectly round head with a pair
of very small round eyes; moreover, his snub nose was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
quite round at the end. He now pursed out his lips
and made his mouth round, too, as if he were going to
whistle. Intentionally or unintentionally, he made
himself look like an idiot, and slowly wagged his bullet
head as if he did not understand.</p>

<p>'The church is open,' he said, at last. 'You may see,'</p>

<p>Omobono now applauded himself for having asked and
obtained a password, but he meant to be cautious in
using it.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' he said politely, and he went on, into
the church.</p>

<p>The sun was low and cast a rich light through the open
door, full upon the grating and closed gate of the sanctuary,
and the gilt and burnished bars reflected and
diffused the warm rays, like a glory before the unseen
high altar. Omobono glanced quickly to the right and
left as he passed between the pillars, but he saw no one.
Farther on, before him and under the wide dome, two
women in brown were at their prayers, the one kneeling,
the other prostrate, in Eastern fashion, her forehead resting
on the marble pavement. There was no man in sight.</p>

<p>Omobono chose a clean spot, hitched up his cloak
in front and knelt upon one knee. He crossed himself
and said a little prayer.</p>

<p>'O Lord,' he prayed, 'grant wealth and honour to
the Most Serene Republic and give Venice the victory
over the Genoese. Bless Messer Carlo Zeno, O Lord,
and preserve him from sudden death. Send bread to the
poor. Give Omobono strength to resist curiosity.
For ever and ever. Amen.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>It was not a very eloquent little prayer and it lacked
the set forms of invocation and doxology which devout
persons use; but Omobono had made it up for himself
long ago, and said it every day at least once, for it precisely
expressed what he sincerely wished and intended
to ask with due humility; and he was a good man, in
spite of his besetting fault, and believed that what he
asked would be granted. As yet, Venice had not triumphed
over those unspeakable dogs of Genoese, though
the day of glory was much nearer than even the Venetians
dared to hope. But so far Carlo Zeno had been
preserved from sudden death in spite of his manifest
tendency to break his neck for any whim; for the rest,
Omobono had more than once been the means of saving
poor people from starvation, though at some risk of it
to himself, poor man; and as for his curiosity, he had at
least kept it so far in bounds as never to read his master's
letters until his master had opened them himself, which
was something for Omobono to be grateful for. On
the whole, he judged that his small prayer was not unacceptable,
and he used it every day.</p>

<p>He knelt a moment after he had finished it, partly
because he was a little ashamed of its being very short
though he never could think of anything to add to it,
and he did not wish people to think that he was irreverent
and gabbled over a prayer merely as a form; for he was
very sensitive about such things, being a shy man. And
partly he remained on his knees a little longer because
the gilded grating was very handsome in the light of the
setting sun, and reminded him of the grating in Saint
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
Mark's, and that naturally made him think of heaven.
But presently he rose and went out.</p>

<p>The sacristan was still standing by the same pillar.</p>

<p>'Kyrios Rustan is not in the church,' said Omobono,
stopping again.</p>

<p>Once more the sacristan seemed to be about to purse
his lips into a circle, and to put on an air of blank stupidity,
and the clerk saw that the time had come to use
the password.</p>

<p>'I must see him,' he said, dropping his voice, but speaking
very distinctly. 'I beg you to direct me by four toes
and five toes, so that I may find him.'</p>

<p>The sacristan's face and manner changed at once.
His small eyes were suddenly full of intelligence, his
mouth expanded in a friendly smile, and his snub nose
seemed to draw itself to a point like the muzzle of a hound
on a scent.</p>

<p>'Why did you not say that at once?' he asked.
'Rustan left the church a quarter of an hour before you
came, but he is not far away. Do you see the entrance
to the lane down there?'</p>

<p>He pointed towards the place.</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Omobono, 'by the corner.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Go into that lane. Take the first turn to the
left, and then the second to the right again. Before you
have gone far you will find Rustan walking up and down.'</p>

<p>'Walking up and down?' repeated Omobono, surprised
that the Bokharian should select for his afternoon
stroll such a place as one might expect to find in the
direction indicated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes.' The sacristan grinned and winked at the
Venetian clerk in a knowing way. 'He is a devout man.
When he has said his prayers he walks up and down in
that little lane.'</p>

<p>The man laughed audibly, but immediately looked
behind him to see whether any one coming from within
the church had heard him, for he considered himself a
clerical character. Omobono thanked him politely.</p>

<p>'It is nothing,' answered the sacristan. 'A mere direction&mdash;what
is it? If I had asked you for your purse
and cloak by four toes and five toes, I am quite sure that
you would have given me both.'</p>

<p>'Of course,' replied Omobono nervously, seeing that the
reply was evidently expected of him. 'Of course I
would. And so, good-day, my friend.'</p>

<p>'And good-day to you, friend,' returned the sacristan.</p>

<p>The clerk went away, devoutly hoping that no unknown
person would suddenly accost him and demand
of him his cloak in the name of four toes and five toes,
and he wondered what in the world he should do if
such a thing happened to him. He was quite sure
that he should be unable to hide the fact that he knew
the magic formula, for he had never been very good at
deception; and if the words could procure such instant
obedience from such a disagreeable person as the sacristan
had at first seemed to be, some dreadful penalty was
probably the portion of those who disobeyed the mandate.</p>

<p>Thus reflecting, and by no means easy in his mind, the
clerk crossed the square and entered the lane. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
supposed that it led to a continuation of the Bokharian
quarter, but he at once saw his mistake. Even now a
man may live for years in Constantinople and yet be far
from knowing every corner of it, and Omobono found
himself in a part of the city which he had never seen.
It was in ruins, and yet it was inhabited. Few of the
houses had doors, hardly any window had a shutter, and
as he passed, he saw that in many lower rooms the light
fell from above, through a fallen floor and a broken
roof above it.</p>

<p>Yet in every ruined dwelling, and almost at every
door, there was some one, and all were frightful to see;
all were in rags that hardly clung together, and some
could scarcely cover themselves modestly; one was blind,
another had no arms or no legs, another was devoured
by hideous disease&mdash;many were mere bundles of bones
in scanty rags, and stretched out filthy skeleton hands
for alms as the decently dressed clerk came near. Omobono
stood still for a moment when he realised that he
was in the beggars' quarter, where more than half the
dying paupers of the great city took refuge amidst houses
ruined and burnt long ago when the Crusaders had sacked
Constantinople, and never more than half repaired since
then.</p>

<p>The clerk stood still, for the sight of so much misery
hurt him, and it hurt him still more to think that he had
but very few small coins in his wallet. The poor creatures
should have them all, one by one, but there would
be few indeed for so many.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_041" id="i_041"></a>
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="403" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">He was talking with an old beggar woman.</p>
</div>

<p>And then, as he took out a little piece of bronze money,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
he heard sounds like nothing he had heard before; like
many hundred sighs of suffering all breathed out together;
and again, like many dying persons praying in
low, exhausted voices; and again, like a gentle, hopeless
wail; and through it all there was a pitiful tremor of
weakness and pain that went to the clerk's heart. He
could do very little, and he was obliged to go on, for his
errand was pressing, and the people were as wretched at
one door as they would be at the next, so that it was better
not to give all his coins at once. He dropped one here,
one there, into the wasted hands, and went on quickly,
scarcely daring to glance at the faces that appeared
at the low doors and ruined windows. Yet here and
there he looked in, almost against his will, and he saw
sights that sent a cold chill down his back, sights I have
seen, too, but need not tell of. And so he went on,
turning as the sacristan had instructed him, till he saw
a tall, thin man in a brown cloth gown edged with cheap
fox's fur, and having a tight fur cap on his head. He was
talking with an old beggar woman, and his back was
turned so that Omobono could only see that he had a long
black beard, but he recognised Rustan, the Bokharian
dealer. The house before which the two were standing
seemed a trifle better than the rest in the street; there
were crazy shutters to the large lower windows, which
were open, however; there was a door which was ajar,
and an attempt had been made to scrape the mud from
the threshold. For the street was damp and muddy after
the spring rains, but not otherwise very dirty. There was
no garbage, not so much as a cabbage-stalk or a bleaching
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
bone; for bones can be ground to dust between stones
and eaten with water, and a cabbage-stalk is half a dinner
to a starving man.</p>

<p>In spite of the prayer he had recently offered up
against his besetting fault of curiosity, Omobono could
not help treading very lightly as he came up behind the
Bokharian, and as the mud was in a pasty state, neither
hard nor slimy, his heavy boots made hardly any more
noise in treading on it than a beggar's bare feet. In this
way he advanced till he could see through an open window
of the house, and he stood still and looked in, but
he made as if he were politely waiting for Rustan to turn
round. Either the old beggar woman was blind, or she
thought fit not to call the Bokharian's attention to the
fact that a well-dressed stranger was standing within
a few feet of him. The two talked volubly in low tones
and in the Bokharian language, which Omobono did
not understand at all, and when he was quite sure that
he could not follow the conversation he occupied his
curiosity in watching what was going on inside the
house. The window was low, having apparently once
served as a shop in which the shopkeeper had sat, in
Eastern fashion, half inside and half out, to wait upon
his customers. During half a minute, which elapsed
before Rustan turned round, the clerk saw a good
deal.</p>

<p>In the first place his eyes fell on the upturned face of a
woman who was certainly in the extremity of dangerous
illness, and was probably dying. She had been beautiful
once and she had beauty still, that was not only the soft
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
shadow of coming death. The wasted body was covered
with nameless rags, but the pillow was white and clean;
the refined face was the colour of pure wax, and the dark
hair, grey at the temples, had been carefully combed out
and smoothed back from the forehead. The woman's
eyes were closed, and deeply shadowed by suffering, but
her delicate nostrils quivered now and then as she drew
breath, and her pale lips moved a little as though trying
to speak.</p>

<p>There were young children round the wretched bed,
silent, thin, and wondering, as children are when the
great mystery is very near them and they feel it. In their
miserable tatters one could hardly have told whether
the younger ones were boys or girls, but one was much
older than the rest, and Omobono's eyes fixed themselves
upon her, and he held his breath, lest the Bokharian
should hear him and turn, and hide the vision and break
the spell.</p>

<p>The girl was standing on the other side of the sick
woman, bending down a very little, and watching her
features with a look of infinite care and sorrow. One
exquisite white hand touched the poor coverings of the
bed, rather than rested on them, as if it longed to be of
some use, and to relieve the woman's suffering ever so
little. But the clerk did not look at the delicate fingers,
for his eyes were riveted on the young girl's face. It
was thin and white, but its lines were beautiful beyond
comparison with all that he had ever seen, even in Venice,
the city of beautiful women.</p>

<p>I think that true beauty is beyond description; you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
may describe the changeless, faultless outlines of a statue
to a man who has seen good statues and can recall them;
you can perhaps find words to describe the glow, and
warmth, and deep texture of a famous picture, and what
you write will mean something to those who know the
master's work; you may even conjure up an image before
untutored eyes. But neither minute description nor
well-turned phrase, neither sensuous adjective nor
spiritual simile can tell half the truth of a beautiful
living thing.</p>

<p>And the fairest living woman is twice beautiful when
gladness or love or anger or sorrow rises in her eyes, for
then her soul is in her face. As Omobono looked through
the window and watched the beggar girl leaning over
her dying mother, he hardly saw the perfect line of the
cheek, the dark and sweeping lashes or the deep brown
eyes&mdash;the firm and rounded chin, the very tender mouth,
the high-bred nostrils or the rich brown hair. He could
not clearly recall any of those things a few minutes later;
he only knew that he had seen for once something he had
heard of all his life. It was not till he dreamt of her face
that night&mdash;dreaming, poor man, that she was his
guardian angel come to reprove him for his curiosity&mdash;that
the details all came back, and most of all that brave
and tender little mouth of hers, so delicately womanly
and yet so strong, and that unspeakable turn of the cheek
between the eye and the ear, and that poise of the small
head on the slender neck&mdash;the details came back then.
But in the first moment he only saw the whole and felt
that it was perfect; then, for an instant, the eyes looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
at him across the dying woman; and in a moment more
the Bokharian turned, caught sight of him and came
quickly forward, and the spell was broken.</p>

<p>Rustan Karaboghazji held out both hands to Omobono,
as if he were greeting his dearest friend, and he spoke
in fluent Italian. He was a young man still, not much
past thirty, with dark, straight features, stony grey eyes,
and a magnificent black beard.</p>

<p>'What happy chance brings you here?' he cried, immediately
drawing the Venetian in the direction whence
the latter had come. 'Fortunate indeed is Friday, the
day of Venus, since it brings me into the path of my
honoured Ser Omobono!'</p>

<p>'Indeed, it is no accident, Kyrios Rustan&mdash;&mdash;' began
Omobono.</p>

<p>'A double fortune, then, since a friend needs me,' continued
the Bokharian, without the slightest hesitation.
'But do not call me Kyrios, Ser Omobono! First, I am
not Greek, and then, my honoured friend, I am no Kyrios,
but only a poor exile from my country, struggling to keep
body and soul together among strangers.'</p>

<p>While he talked he had drawn Omobono's arm through
his own and was leading him away from the house with
considerable haste. The Venetian looked back, and saw
that the old woman had disappeared.</p>

<p>'I have a message from my master,' he said, 'but before
we go on, I should like to&mdash;&mdash;' he hesitated, and stopped
in spite of Rustan.</p>

<p>'What should you like to do?' asked the latter, with
sudden sharpness.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>Omobono's hand felt for the last of the small coins in
his wallet.</p>

<p>'I wish to give a trifle to the poor people in that house,'
he said, summoning his courage. 'I saw a sick woman&mdash;she
seemed to be dying&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But Rustan grasped his wrist and held it firmly, as
if to make him put the money back, but he smiled gently
at the same time.</p>

<p>'No, no, my friend,' he answered. 'I would not have
spoken of it, but you force me to tell you that I have been
before you there! I take some interest in those poor
people, and I have just given enough to keep them for a
week, when I shall come again. It is not wise to give
too much. The other beggars would rob them if they
guessed that there was anything to take. Come, come!
The sun is setting, and it is not well to be in this quarter
so late.'</p>

<p>Omobono remembered how the sacristan had winked
and laughed, when he had spoken of Rustan's walks in
the dismal lane, and the Venetian now proceeded to draw
from what he had seen and heard a multitude of very
logical inferences. That Rustan was an utter scoundrel
he had never doubted since he had known him, and that
his domestic life was perhaps not to his taste, Omobono
guessed since he had seen the red-haired negress who
was his wife. Nothing could be more natural than that
the Bokharian, having discovered the beautiful, half-starved
creature whom Omobono had first seen through
the window, should plot to get her into his power for his
own ends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>Having reached this conclusion, the mild little clerk
suddenly felt the blood of a hero beating in his veins
and longed to take Karaboghazji by the throat and shake
him till he was senseless, never doubting but that the
cause of justice would miraculously give him the strength
needed for the enterprise. He submitted to be hurried
away, indeed, because the moment was evidently not
propitious for a feat of knight-errantry; but as he walked
he struck his cornel stick viciously into the pasty mud and
shut his mouth tight under his well-trimmed grey beard.</p>

<p>'And now,' said Rustan, drawing something like a
breath of relief as they emerged into the open space
before the church, 'pray tell me what urgent business
brings you so far to find me, and tell me, too, how you
came to know where I was.'</p>

<p>Here Omobono suddenly realised that in his deductions
he had made some great mistake; for if Rustan had been
in the beggars' quarter for such a purpose as the Venetian
suspected, how was it possible that he should have left
any sort of directions with his wife and the sacristan
for finding him, in case he should be wanted on some
urgent business? Omobono, always charitable, at
once concluded that he had been led away into judging
the man unjustly.</p>

<p>'Messer Carlo Zeno, the Venetian merchant, is very
anxious to see you this very evening,' he said. 'From
his manner, I suspect that the business will not bear any
delay and that it may be profitable to you.'</p>

<p>Rustan smiled, bent his head and walked quickly,
but said nothing for several moments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>'Does Messer Zeno need money?' he asked presently.
'If so, let us stop at my house and I will see what little
sum I can dispose of.'</p>

<p>Mild as Omobono was, an angry, contemptuous answer
rose to his lips, but he checked it in time.</p>

<p>'My master never borrows,' he answered, with immense
dignity. 'I can only tell you that so far as I
know he wishes to see you in regard to some commission
with which a friend in Venice has charged him.'</p>

<p>Rustan smiled more pleasantly than ever, and walked
still faster.</p>

<p>'We will go directly to Messer Zeno's house, then,'
he said. 'This is a most fortunate day for buying and
selling, and perhaps I have precisely what he wants.
We shall see, we shall see!'</p>

<p>Omobono's thin little legs had hard work to keep up
with the Bokharian's untiring stride, and though Rustan
made a remark now and then, the clerk could hardly
answer him for lack of breath. The sun had set and it
was almost dark when they reached Zeno's house, and
the secretary knocked at the door of his master's private
room.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p>When it was quite dark the old woman came back with
something hidden under her tattered shawl, and Zoë drew
the rotten shutters that barely hung by the hinges and
fastened them inside with bits of rain-bleached cord
that were knotted through holes in the wood. She also
shut the door and put up a wooden bar across it. While
she was doing this she could hear Anastasia, the crazy
paralytic who lived farther down the lane, singing a sort
of mad litany of hunger to herself in the dark. It was
the thin nasal voice of a starving lunatic, rising sharply
and then dying away in a tuneless wail:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Holy Mother, send us a little food, for we are hungry!</p>

<p>Kyrie eleeison! Eleeison!</p>

<p>Blessed Michael Archangel, gives us meat, for we
starve! Eleeison!</p>

<p>O blessed Charalambos, for the love of Heaven, a kid
roasted on the coals and good bread with it! Eleeison,
eleeison! We are hungry!</p>

<p>Holy Sergius and Bacchus, Martyrs, have mercy upon
us and send us a savoury meal of pottage! Eleeison!
Pottage with oil and pepper! Eleeison, eleeison!</p>

<p>Holy Peter and Paul and Zacharius, send your angels
with fish, and with meat, and with sweet cooked herbs!
Eleeison, let us eat and be filled, and sleep! Eleeison!
Spread us your heavenly tables, and let us drink of the
good water from the heavenly spring!</p>

<p>Oh, we are hungry! We are starving! Eleeison!
Eleeison! Eleeison!</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span></p>

<p>The miserable, crazy voice rose to a piercing scream,
that made Zoë shudder; and then there came a little
low, faint wailing, as the mad woman collapsed in her
chair, dreaming perhaps that her prayer was about to be
answered.</p>

<p>Zoë had shut the door, and there was now a little
light in the ruined room; for Nectaria, the old beggar
woman, had been crouching in a corner over an earthen
pan in which a few live coals were buried under ashes,
and she had blown upon them till they glowed and had
kindled a splinter of dry wood to a flame, and with this
she had lit the small wick of an earthen lamp which held
mingled oil and sheep's fat. But she placed the light
on the stone floor so shaded that not a single ray could
fall towards the door or the cracked shutters, lest some
late returning beggar should see a glimmer from outside
and guess that there was something to get by breaking
in and stealing; for they were only three women, one
dying, one very old, and the third Zoë herself, and two
young children, and some of the beggars were strong men
who had only lost one eye, or perhaps one hand, which
had been chopped off for stealing.</p>

<p>When the light was burning Zoë could see that the
sick woman was awake, and she poured out some milk
from a small jug which Nectaria had brought, and
warmed it over the coals in a cracked cup, and held
it to the tired lips, propping up the pillow with her
other hand. And the sick one drank, and tried to
smile.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nectaria spread out the rest of the supplies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
she had brought on a clean board; there was a small
black loaf and three little fishes fried in oil, such as could
be bought where food is cooked at the corners of the
streets for the very poor. The two children gazed at this
delicious meal with hungry eyes. They were boys, not
more than seven and eight years old, and their rags were
tied to them, to cover them, with all sorts of bits of
string and strips of torn linen. But they were quite
quiet, and did not try to take their share till Zoë came
to the board and broke the black loaf into four equal
portions with her white fingers. There was a piece
for each of the boys, and a piece for Nectaria, and the
girl kept a piece for herself; but she would not take a
fish, as there were only three.</p>

<p>'This is all I could buy for the money,' said Nectaria.
'The milk is very dear now.'</p>

<p>'Why do you give it to me?' asked the sick woman,
in a sweet and faint voice. 'You are only feeding the
dead, and the living need the food.'</p>

<p>'Mother!' cried Zoë reproachfully, 'if you love us,
do not talk of leaving us! The Bokharian has promised
to bring a physician to see you, and to give us money
for what you need. He will come in the morning, early
in the morning, and you shall be cured, and live! Is it
not as I say, Nectaria?'</p>

<p>The old woman nodded her head in answer as she
munched her black bread, but would say nothing, and
would not look up. There was silence for a while.</p>

<p>'And what have you promised the Bokharian?' asked
the mother at last, fixing her sad eyes on Zoë's face.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
'Did ever one of his people give one of us anything
without return?'</p>

<p>'I have promised nothing,' Zoë answered, meeting her
mother's gaze quietly. Yet there was a shade of effort
in her tone.</p>

<p>'Nothing yet,' said the sick woman. 'I understand.
But it will come&mdash;it will come too soon!'</p>

<p>She turned away her face on the pillow and the last
words were hardly audible. The little boys did not hear
them, and would not have understood; but old Nectaria
heard and made signs to Zoë. The signs meant that by
and by, when the sick woman should be dozing, Nectaria
had something to tell; and Zoë nodded.</p>

<p>There was silence again till all had finished eating and
had drunk in turn from the earthen jar of water. Then
they sat still and silent for a little while, and though the
windows and the door were shut they could hear the
mad woman singing again:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Eleeison! Spread heavenly tables! Eleeison! We
are starving! Eleeison! Eleeison! Eleeison!</p>
</div>

<p>The sick woman breathed softly and regularly. The
little boys grew sleepy and nodded, and huddled against
each other as they sat. Then old Nectaria took the light
and led them, half asleep, to a sort of bunk of boards and
dry straw, in a small inner room, and put them to bed,
covering them as well as she could; and they were soon
asleep. She came back, shading the light carefully
with her hand; and presently, when the sick woman
seemed to be sleeping also, Nectaria and Zoë crept
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
softly to the other end of the room and talked in whispers.</p>

<p>'She is better to-night,' said the girl.</p>

<p>Nectaria shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>'How can any one get well here, without medicine,
without food, without fire?' she asked. 'Yes&mdash;she
is better&mdash;a little. It will only take her longer to die.'</p>

<p>'She shall not die,' said Zoë. 'The Bokharian has
promised money and help.'</p>

<p>'For nothing? he will give nothing,' Nectaria answered
sadly. 'He talked long with me this afternoon, out in
the street. I implored him to give us a little help now,
till the danger is passed, because if you leave her she will
die.'</p>

<p>'Did you try to make him believe that if he would help
us now you would betray me to him in a few days?'</p>

<p>'Yes, but he laughed at me&mdash;softly and wisely as
Bokharians laugh. He asked me if one should feed wolves
with flesh before baiting the pit-fall that is to catch them.
He says plainly that until you can make up your mind,
we shall have only the three pennies he gives us every
day, and if your mother dies, so much the worse; and if
the children die, so much the worse; and if I die, so much
the worse; for he says you are the strongest of us and
will outlive us all.'</p>

<p>'It is true!' Zoë clasped her hands against the wall
and pressed her forehead against them, closing her eyes.
'It is true,' she repeated, in the same whisper, 'I am so
strong!'</p>

<p>Old Nectaria stood beside her and laid one wrinkled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
cheek to the cold wall, so that her face was near Zoë's,
and they could still talk.</p>

<p>'If I refuse,' said the girl, quivering a little in her distress,
'I shall see you all die before my eyes, one by one!'</p>

<p>'Yet, if you leave your mother now&mdash;&mdash;' the old
woman began.</p>

<p>'She has lived through much more than losing me,'
answered Zoë. 'My father's long imprisonment, his
awful death!' she shuddered now, from head to foot.</p>

<p>Nectaria laid a withered hand sympathetically on her
trembling shoulder, but Zoë mastered herself after a
moment's silence and turned her face to her companion.</p>

<p>'You must make her think that I shall come back,'
she whispered. 'There is no other way&mdash;unless I give
my soul, too. That would kill her indeed&mdash;she could
not live through that!'</p>

<p>'And to think that my old bones are worth nothing!'
sighed the poor old woman; she took the rags of Zoë's
tattered sleeve and pressed them to her lips.</p>

<p>But Zoë bent down, for she was the taller by a head,
and she tenderly kissed the wrinkled face.</p>

<p>'Hush!' she whispered softly. 'You will wake her
if you cry. I must do it, Ria, to save you all from death,
since I can. If I wait longer, I shall grow thinner, and
though I am so strong I may fall ill. Then I shall be
worth nothing to the Bokharian.'</p>

<p>'But it is slavery, child! Do you not understand that
it is slavery? That he will take you and sell you in the

<p class="caption">She tenderly kissed the wrinkled face.</p>
</div>

<p>Zoë leaned sideways against the wall, and the faint
light that shone upwards from the earthen lamp on the
floor, fell upon her lovely upturned face, and on the outlines
of her graceful body, ill-concealed by her thin rags.</p>

<p>'Is it true that I am still beautiful?' she asked after
a pause.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered the old woman, looking at her, 'it is
true. You were not a pretty child, you were sallow, and
your nose&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Zoë interrupted her.</p>

<p>'Do you think that many girls as beautiful as I are
offered in the slave market?'</p>

<p>'Not in my time,' answered the old woman. 'When
I was in the market I never saw one that could compare
with you.'</p>

<p>She had been sold herself, when she was thirteen.</p>

<p>'Of course,' she added, 'the handsome ones were kept
apart from us and were better fed before they were sold,
but we waited on them&mdash;we whom no one would buy
except to make us work&mdash;and so we saw them every
day.'</p>

<p>'He says he will give a hundred Venetian ducats for
me, does he not?'</p>

<p>'Yes; and you are worth three hundred anywhere,'
answered the old slave, and the tears came to her eyes,
though she tried to squeeze them back with her crooked
fingers.</p>

<p>The sick woman called to the two in a weak voice.
Zoë was at her side instantly, and Nectaria shuffled as
fast as she could to the pan of coals and crouched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
down to blow upon the embers in order to warm some
milk.</p>

<p>'I am cold,' complained the sufferer, 'so cold!'</p>

<p>Zoë found one of her hands and began to chafe it
gently between her own.</p>

<p>'It is like ice,' she said.</p>

<p>The girl was ill-clothed enough, as it was, and the early
spring night was chilly; but she slipped off her ragged
outer garment, the long-skirted coat of the Greeks, and
spread it over the other wretched coverings of the bed,
tucking it in round her mother's neck.</p>

<p>'But you, child?' protested the sick woman feebly.</p>

<p>'I am too hot, mother,' answered Zoë, whose teeth were
chattering.</p>

<p>Nectaria brought the warm milk, and Zoë lifted the
pillow as she had done before, and held the cup to the
eager lips till the liquid was all gone.</p>

<p>'It is of no use,' sighed her mother. 'I shall die. I
shall not live till morning.'</p>

<p>She had been a very great lady of Constantinople, the
Kyría Agatha, wife of the Protosparthos Michael Rhangabé,
whom the Emperor Andronicus had put to death
with frightful tortures more than a year ago, because he
had been faithful to the Emperor Johannes. Until her
husband had been imprisoned, she had spent her life in
a marble palace by the Golden Horn, or in a beautiful
villa on the Bosphorus. She had lived delicately and
had loved her existence, and even after all her husband's
goods had been confiscated as well as all her own, she
had lived in plenty for many months with her children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
borrowing here and there of her friends and relatives.
But they had forsaken her at last; not but that some of
them were generous and would have supported her for
years, if it had been only a matter of money, but it had
become a question of life and death after Rhangabé had
been executed, and none of them would risk being blinded,
or maimed, or perhaps strangled for the sake of helping
her. Then she had fallen into abject poverty; her slaves
had all been taken from her with the rest of the property
and sold again in the market, but old Nectaria had hidden
herself and so had escaped; and she, who knew the
city, had brought Kyría Agatha and her three children
to the beggars' quarter as a last refuge, when no one
would take them in. The old slave had toiled for them,
and begged for them, and would have stolen for them if
she had not been profoundly convinced that stealing was
not only a crime punishable at the very least by the loss
of the right hand, but that it was also a much greater
sin because it proved that the thief did not believe in
the goodness of Providence. For Providence, said Nectaria,
was always right, and so long as men did right, men
and Providence must necessarily agree; in other words,
all would end well, either on earth or in heaven. But to
steal, or kill by treachery, or otherwise to injure one's
neighbour for one's own advantage, was to interfere with
the ways of Providence, and people who did such things
would in the end find themselves in a place diametrically
opposite to that heaven in which Providence resided. Of
its kind, Nectaria's reasoning was sound, and whether
truly philosophical or not, it was undeniably moral.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>Zoë was not Kyría Agatha's own daughter. No
children had been born to the Protosparthos and his
wife for several years after their marriage, and at last,
in despair, they had adopted a little baby girl, the child
of a young Venetian couple who had both died of the
cholera that periodically visited Constantinople. Kyría
Agatha and Rhangabé brought her up as their own
daughter, and again years passed by; then, at last, two
boys were born to them within eighteen months. Michael
Rhangabé's affection for the adopted girl never suffered
the slightest change. Kyría Agatha loved her own
children better, as any mother would, and as any children
would have a right to expect when they were old
enough to reason. She had not been unkind to Zoë,
still less had she conceived a dislike for her; but she had
grown indifferent to her and had looked forward with
pleasure to the time when the girl should marry and leave
the house. Then the great catastrophe had come, and
loss of fortune, and at last beggary and actual starvation;
and though Zoë's devotion had grown deeper and
more unselfish with every trial, the elder woman's
anxiety now, in her last dire extremity, was for her boys
first, then for herself, and for Zoë last of all.</p>

<p>The girl knew the truth about her birth, for Rhangabé
himself had not thought it right that she should be
deceived, but she had not the least recollection of her
own parents; the Protosparthos and his wife had been
her real father and mother and had been kind, and it
was her nature to be grateful and devoted. She saw
that the Kyría loved the boys best, but she was already
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
too womanly not to feel that human nature must have
its way where the ties of flesh and blood are concerned;
and besides, if her adoptive mother had been cruel and
cold, instead of only indifferent where she had once
been loving, the girl would still have given her life
for her, for dead Rhangabé's sake. While he had
lived, she had almost worshipped him; in his last
agonies he had sent a message to his wife and children,
and to her, which by some happy miracle had been
delivered; and now that he was dead she was ready to
die for those who had been his; more than that, she
was willing to be sold into slavery for them.</p>

<p>She stood by the bedside only half covered, and she
tried to think of something more that she might do, while
she gazed on the pale face that was turned up to hers.</p>

<p>'Are you warmer, now?' she asked tenderly.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;a little. Thank you, child.'</p>

<p>Kyría Agatha closed her eyes again, but Zoë still
watched her. The conviction grew in the girl that the
real danger was over, and that the delicately nurtured
woman only needed care and warmth and food. That
was all, but that was the unattainable, since there was
nothing left that could be sold; nothing but Zoë's rare
and lovely self. A hundred golden ducats were a fortune.
In old Nectaria's hands such a sum would buy
real comfort for more than a year, and in that time no
one could tell what might happen. A turn of fortune
might bring the Emperor John back to the throne.
He had been a weak ruler, but neither cruel nor ungrateful,
and surely he would provide for the widow of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
Commander of his Guards who had perished in torment
for being faithful to him. Then Zoë's freedom might be
bought again, and she would go into a convent and live
a good life to the end, in expiation of such evil as might
be thrust upon her as a bought slave.</p>

<p>This she could do, and this she must do, for there was
no other way to save Agatha's life, and the lives of the
little boys.</p>

<p>'A little more milk,' said the sick woman, opening her
eyes again.</p>

<p>Nectaria crouched over the embers, and warmed what
was left of the milk. Zoë, watching her movements,
saw that it was the last; but Kyría Agatha was surely
better, and would ask for more during the night, and there
would be none to give her; none, perhaps, until nearly
noon to-morrow.</p>

<p>Nectaria took the pan of coals away to replenish it,
going out to the back of the ruined house in order to
light the charcoal in the open air. The sick woman closed
her eyes again, being momentarily satisfied and warm.</p>

<p>Zoë sank upon her knees beside the bed, forgetting that
she was cold and half-starved, as the tide of her thoughts
rose in a wave of despair.</p>

<p>The fitful night breeze wafted the words of the mad
woman's crooning along the lane, 'Eleeison! Eleeison!'</p>

<p>And Zoë unconsciously answered, as she would have
answered in church, 'Kyrie eleeison!'</p>

<p>'Blessed Michael, Archangel, give us meat, we starve!'
came the wild song, now high and distinct.</p>

<p>'Kyrie eleeison!' answered Zoë on her knees.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>Then she sprang to her feet like a startled animal.
Some one had knocked at the door. With one hand she
gathered her thin rags across her bosom, the other unconsciously
went to the sick woman's shoulder, as if at
once to reassure her and to bid her be silent.</p>

<p>Again the knocking came, discreet still, but a little
louder than before. Nectaria was still away and busy
with the pan of coals, and the sick woman heard nothing,
for she was sound asleep at last. Zoë saw this, and drew
her bare feet out of her patched slippers before she ran
lightly to the door.</p>

<p>'Who knocks?' she asked in a very low tone, clasping
her tattered garment to her body.</p>

<p>The Bokharian's smooth voice answered her in oily
accents.</p>

<p>'I am Rustan,' he said. 'I am suddenly obliged to go
on a journey, and I start at dawn.'</p>

<p>Zoë held her breath, for she felt that the last chance
of saving her mother was slipping away.</p>

<p>'Do you hear me?' asked Rustan, outside.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'Will you make up your mind? I will give half as
much again as I promised.'</p>

<p>The girl's face had been pale; it turned white now, for
the great moment had come very suddenly. She made
an effort to swallow, in order to speak distinctly, and she
glanced towards the bed. Kyría Agatha was in a deep
sleep.</p>

<p>'Have your brought the money with you?' Zoë asked,
almost panting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>The hand that grasped the rags to keep them together
pressed desperately against her heart. While Rustan
could have counted ten, there was silence. Twice again
she looked towards the bed and then, with infinite precaution,
she slipped out the wooden bar that kept the
door closed. Once more she drew her rags over her, for
they had fallen back when she used both her hands. She
opened the door a little, and saw Rustan muffled in a
cloak, his eager face and black beard thrust forward in
anticipation of entering. But she stopped him, and held
out one hand.</p>

<p>'My mother has fallen into a deep sleep,' she said.
'Give me the money and I will go with you.'</p>

<p>Without hesitation Rustan placed in her outstretched
hand a small bag made of coarse sail-cloth, and closely
tied with hemp twine.</p>

<p>'How much is it?' she whispered.</p>

<p>'One hundred and fifty gold ducats,' answered the
Bokharian under his breath, for he knew that if he
did not wake the sleeping woman there would be less
trouble.</p>

<p>At that moment Nectaria came back from within,
with the pan of coals. Zoë caught her eye and held out
the heavy little bag. The woman stared, looked at
Kyría Agatha's sleeping face, set down the pan upon the
floor, and came forward.</p>

<p>'He has brought the money, a hundred and fifty ducats,'
Zoë whispered, forcing the bag into Nectaria's trembling
hands. 'It is the only way. Good-bye&mdash;quick&mdash;shut
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
the door before she wakes&mdash;tell her I am asleep in
the straw&mdash;God bless you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Eleeison! Eleeison!' came the wail of the mad
woman on the wind.</p>

<p>Before Nectaria could answer Zoë had pulled the door
till it shut behind her, and was outside, barefooted on
the hardening mud, and scarcely covered. She said
nothing now, and Rustan was silent too, but he had taken
one of her wrists and held it firmly without hurting it.
The fleet young creature might make a dash for freedom
yet, foolish as that would be, since he could easily force
his way into the ruined house and take back his money
if she escaped him. But he had nearly lost a young
slave once before, and he would risk nothing, so he kept
his strong hand tightly clasped round the slender wrist,
though Zoë walked beside him quietly in the deep gloom,
thinking only of covering herself from his gaze, though
indeed he could scarcely see the outline of her figure.</p>

<p>They went on quickly. For the last time, as Rustan
led her round a sharp turn, she heard the wild cry of the
poor mad creature she had listened to so often by day
and in the dead of night. Then she was in another
street and could hear it no more.</p>

<p>She was not allowed time to think of her condition yet.
A few steps farther and Rustan stopped short, still holding
her fast by the wrist, and she saw that they had come
upon a group of men who were waiting for them. One
suddenly held up a lantern which had been covered,
and now shed a yellow light through thin leaves of horn,
and Zoë saw that he was a big Ethiopian, as black as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
ebony. She drew her tatters still more closely over her
with her free hand and turned away from the light, as
well as Rustan's unrelaxing hold would allow.</p>

<p>A moment later some one she could not see threw a
wide warm cloak over her shoulders from behind her, and
she caught it gladly and drew the folds to her breast.</p>

<p>'Get into the litter,' said Rustan, sharply but not
loudly.</p>

<p>There was nothing soft or oily in his tone now. He had
bought her and she was a part of his property. Four
men had lifted a covered palanquin and held it up with
the small open door just in front of her. She turned,
sat upon the edge, and bent her head to slip into the conveyance
backwards, as Eastern women learn to do very
easily. Rustan held her wrist till she was ready to draw
in her feet, and as he let her go at last she disappeared
within. He instantly closed the sliding panel and fastened
it with a bronze pin. There were half-a-dozen round
holes in each door to let in air, not quite big enough to
allow the passage of an ordinary woman's hand.</p>

<p>Zoë sank back in the close darkness and found herself
leaning against yielding pillows covered with soft leather.
The palanquin began to move steadily forwards, hardly
swaying from side to side, and not rising or falling at all,
as the porters walked on with a smooth, shuffling gait,
each timing his step a fraction of a second later than
that of the man next before him; lest, by all keeping step
together, they should set their burden swinging, which is
intolerable to the person carried.</p>

<p>Four men carried the litter, a fifth, armed with an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
iron-shod staff, went before with the lantern, and Rustan
followed after. There was nothing in the appearance
of the party to excite surprise or curiosity in a city
where every well-to-do person who went out in the evening
was carried in a palanquin, and accompanied by at
least two trusty servants. For that matter, too, Rustan's
business was perfectly legitimate, and it concerned
no one that he should have a newly bought beauty
carried in a closed litter from a distant quarter of the
city to his home.</p>

<p>It was true that he had no receipt for his money,
acknowledging that it was the stipulated price paid for
a full-grown white maid between eighteen and nineteen
years old, with brown eyes, brown hair, twenty-eight
teeth, all sound, and a pale complexion; who weighed
about two Attic talents and five minæ, and measured
just six palms, standing on her bare feet. In strict law,
he should have had such a document, signed by the
father or mother or owner of the slave, but he knew that
he was quite safe without it. Like all Bokharians, he
was a profound judge of human nature, and he was quite
sure that having once submitted to her fate Zoë would not
cheat him by claiming the freedom she had sacrificed;
moreover, he knew that the adopted daughter of Michael
Rhangabé who had died on the stake in the Hippodrome
as an enemy of the reigning Emperor, would have
but a small chance of obtaining justice, even if she attempted
to prove that she had been carried off by force.
Rustan Karaboghazji felt that his position was unassailable
as he followed the litter that carried his latest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
bargain through the winding streets of Constantinople
towards the narrow lane, one side of which was formed
by that mysterious wall which had but one door in it.</p>

<p>He was well pleased with his day's business, for he was
quite sure that he had netted a handsome profit. Under
his cloak he held a string of beads in one hand, and as he
walked he made the calculation of his probable gains,
pushing the beads along the string with his thumb. He
had paid one hundred and fifty gold ducats for Zoë;
but fifty of them were at least a quarter of their value
under weight, so that the actual value of the gold was
one hundred and thirty-seven and a half ducats. He was
quite sure that Zeno would approve the purchase on a
careful inspection, and that he would be willing to give
three hundred and fifty sequins, though the girl was a
little over age, as slaves' ages were counted. She should
have been between sixteen and seventeen, yet she was
exceptionally pretty, and spoke three languages&mdash;Greek,
Latin, and Italian. If Zeno paid the price, the clear
profit would be two hundred and twelve and a half
ducats. The beads worked quickly in Rustan's fingers,
and his hard grey eyes gleamed in the dark. Two
hundred and twelve and a half on one hundred and thirty-seven
and a half, by the new Venetian method of so
much in the hundred, which was a very convenient way
of reckoning profits, meant one hundred and fifty-four
and a half per centum. The beads worked furiously,
as the merchant's imagination carried him off into a
mercantile paradise where he could make a hundred and
fifty per cent on his capital every day of the year except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Sundays and high feast days. This calculation was
complicated, even for a Bokharian brain, but it was a
delightful one to follow out, and Rustan's blood coursed
pleasantly through his veins as he walked behind his
purchase.</p>

<p>He had lost no time after he had left the beggars'
quarter late in the afternoon, by no means sure that Zoë
meant to surrender at all, and very doubtful as to her
doing so within the next three days. Yet he had boldly
promised that Carlo Zeno should see her on approval on
the following morning. After all, he risked nothing but
a first failure, for if he did not succeed in buying Zoë in
time he could nevertheless show the Venetian merchant
some very pretty wares. Zeno was not a man to waste
words with such a creature as a slave-dealer, and the
interview had not lasted ten minutes. It had taken
longer than that to weigh the ducats in order to be sure
that a certain number of them were under weight. The
only thing Rustan now wished was that he had put many
more light ones into the bag, since it had not even been
opened; for he had naturally expected to be obliged to
count them out before old Nectaria, who had a born
slave's intelligence about money.</p>

<p>Inside the litter the girl lay on her cushions in the
dark, wondering with a sort of horror at what she had
done. She had thought of it indeed, through many days
and sleepless nights, and she did not regret it; she would
not have gone back, now that she had left plenty and
comfort where there had been nothing but ruin and
hunger; but she thought of what was before her and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
prayed that she might close her eyes and die before the
morning came, or better still, before the litter stopped
and Rustan drew back the sliding door.</p>

<p>In an age and a land of slavery, the slave's fate was
familiar to her. She knew that there were public markets
and private markets, and that her beauty, which
meant her value, would save her from the former; but
to the daughter of freeborn parents the difference between
the one and the other was not so great as to be a
consolation. She would be well lodged, well covered,
and well fed, it was true, and she need not fear cruel
treatment; but customers would come, perhaps to-morrow,
and she was to be shown to them like a valuable
horse; they would judge her points and discuss her and
the sum that Rustan would ask; and if they thought the
price too high they would go away and others would
come, and others, till a bargain was struck at last. After
that, she could only think of death as the end. She
knew that many handsome girls were secretly sold to
Sultan Amurad and the Turkish chiefs over in Asia
Minor or in Adrianople, and it was more than likely that
she herself would fare no better, for the conquerors were
lavish with their gold, whereas the Greeks were either
half-ruined nobles or sordid merchants who counted
every penny.</p>

<p>The men carried the litter smoothly and steadily,
never slackening and never hastening their pace. The
time seemed endless. Now and then she heard voices
and many steps, with the clatter of horses' hoofs, which
told her that she was in one of the more frequented streets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
but most of the time she heard scarcely anything but the
shuffling walk of the men in their heavy sandals and the
firmer tread of Rustan's well-shod feet where the road
was hard. She guessed that he was avoiding the great
thoroughfares, probably because the people who thronged
them even at that hour would have hindered the progress
of the palanquin. Zoë knew as well as the dealer that
there was nothing as yet in the transaction which need
be hidden; possibly, if she were afterwards sold to the
Turks, she would be taken across the Bosphorus secretly,
for though there was no law against selling Christian
girls to unbelievers the people of the city looked upon the
traffic with something like horror, and an angry crowd
might rescue the merchandise from the dealer's hands.
Zoë did not expect that rare good fortune, for Rustan
was not a man to run any risks in his business.</p>

<p>As she lay among her cushions, dreading the end of the
journey, but gradually wearying of the future, her
thoughts went back to the first cause of all her misfortunes,
of Michael Rhangabé's awful death, of all the
suffering that had followed them. One man alone had
wrought that evil and much more, one man, the reigning
Emperor Andronicus. Zoë was not revengeful, not cruel,
very far from bloodthirsty; but when she thought of him
she felt that she would kill him if she could, and that it
would only be justice. Suddenly a ray of something
like hope flashed through her darkness. Nectaria had
told her how beautiful she was; perhaps, being so much
more valuable than most of the slaves that went to the
market, she might be destined for the Emperor himself.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
It was just possible. She set her teeth and clenched her
little hands in the dark. If that should be her fate, the
usurper's days were numbered. She would free her
country from its tyrant and be revenged for Rhangabé's
murder and for all the rest at one quick stroke, though
she might be condemned to die within the hour. That
was indeed something to hope for.</p>

<p>The litter stopped and she heard keys thrust into locks,
and felt that the porters turned short to the left to enter
a door. Her journey through the city was at an end.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p>Rustan stayed behind to shut the outer door, and
Zoë felt that she was carried as much as twenty paces
forward and upwards before the bearers stood still at
last. Then the sliding panel opened, letting in light,
and a strange voice told her to get out. She turned inside
the palanquin and thrust out her naked feet. As she
put them down, expecting to touch bare earth or a stone
pavement, they rested on a rough carpet; at the same instant
she sat on the edge of the litter bending her head
to get out of it and looking round curiously.</p>

<p>Rustan was not there, and in his place she saw a huge
young negress with flaming red hair and rolling eyes,
who roughly ordered the porters to take away the palanquin
and at the same time caught Zoë's wrist, whether
to help her to stand upright or to secure her person it was
hard to say. The girl was much more fearless than
Omobono, the Venetian secretary, and she was not
frightened by the gigantic woman's appearance, as he had
been. In getting out she had managed to gather the
cloak round her, so that the men should not see her in her
rags; for there was light in the large room where she
found herself, and now that she could look about her she
saw a dozen or more girls and young women standing in
small groups a few paces behind the negress. They
surveyed the new arrival curiously, but with different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
expressions. Some seemed to pity her, others smiled as
if to welcome her; one good-looking girl had noticed that
she had no shoes, and her lip curled contemptuously at
such a proof of abject poverty, for she herself was the
daughter of a prosperous Caucasian horse-thief who had
brought her up in plenty and ease in order that she might
fetch a high price. The bearers had now left the room
and there were no men present. Zoë vaguely wished
that they would come back, even the black bearers of
the litter, for she felt a very womanly woman's distrust
of her own sex, where so many who were strangers, and
possibly not well-disposed to her, were gathered together
to look at her.</p>

<p>The negress surveyed her critically by the light of the
large bronze lamp that stood on a stand beside her,
and showed her sharp teeth in an approving smile that
made her thick upper lip roll upwards on itself. She
took the cloak from Zoë's shoulders and scrutinised her
half-clad figure, till she blushed red. Then the daughter
of the Caucasian horse-thief laughed rudely, and some of
the others tittered while the negress gently pinched
Zoë's bare arms and neck to judge of their firmness and
of her general condition. Apparently the examination
was tolerably satisfactory, for the woman nodded and
grinned again. As yet not a word had been spoken since
she had dismissed the bearers, but now she turned
towards the other girls and called two of them.</p>

<p>'Lucilla and Yulia, you shall wait on her,' she said in
Greek. 'The rest of you, to bed! It is already three
hours of the night.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>Two dark-skinned girls in coarse blue linen clothes
came forward with alacrity, evidently much pleased at
being chosen for the office. They were ordinary slave-girls
of fourteen or fifteen years, who would be sold for
house-work, and had no pretensions to good looks.
Their tightly plaited black hair was compressed into the
smallest possible space at the backs of their heads, and
they wore small red caps, coarsely embroidered, but neat
and fresh. Their faces were much alike though they
were not sisters. Zoë saw instantly that they were
children of slaves of nondescript breed with a small
admixture of African blood, of the race that swarmed
in Constantinople.</p>

<p>'Go to bed, I say!' cried the negress to the others, seeing
that some of them were inclined to linger. 'Be off!'</p>

<p>They saw her hand move towards the whip in her
girdle and they ran for the door, crowding on each other
like sheep at the gate when the dogs drive them into the
fold. Having produced this desired result, the negress
turned to Zoë again, and her manner suddenly became
caressing and almost fawning.</p>

<p>'You are mistress here, Kokóna,' she said. 'These
two girls shall wait on you while our humble roof is
honoured by your presence. If you have the slightest
cause of discontent with their service, only tell me, and
they shall be taught their duty.'</p>

<p>Again her hand went significantly to her girdle, and
she rolled her terrible eyes. The two maids shrank visibly
at a threat of which they had already felt the meaning.</p>

<p>Zoë was not so dull as to misunderstand the negress's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
manner. The favourite slave of some high and mighty
personage, of the Emperor himself, perhaps, would have
power, if only for a time, and the wife of Karaboghazji
lost no time in making a bid for such patronage.</p>

<p>'I am a slave, as these girls are,' Zoë answered, laying
a kindly hand on the shoulder of the one nearest to her.</p>

<p>Both maids gazed up into her face with a sort of
wondering gratitude.</p>

<p>'I am here to be sold, just as you are,' Zoë added, returning
their look. The negress laughed loudly, for she
was evidently in a good humour.</p>

<p>'Also the noble peacock and the sparrow are both birds,
though the feathers are different!' she cried. 'But
the Kokóna is hungry and cold,' she continued, in a tone
of servile anxiety for Zoë's comfort. 'Will she not perhaps
take a bath and change her clothes before supper?
Everything is ready.'</p>

<p>'I have supped,' answered Zoë, who had eaten a piece
of black bread, 'but as for clothes, I should like to put on
the cloak again, for I feel cold.'</p>

<p>She had hardly spoken before the two maids had
wrapped her in the warm mantle.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' she said to them, and she turned to
the negress. 'You seem to be mistress here. May I
go to bed now?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I am the mistress,' answered the African woman,
all her teeth gleaming in the lamplight. 'I am Rustan
Karaboghazji's wife, Kokóna.'</p>

<p>Zoë could not repress a movement of surprise. The
negress laughed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>'Rustan is a wise man,' she said with a tremendous
grin. 'It is cheaper to marry one woman with a strong
hand than to keep a couple of smooth-faced thieves for
gaolers, as most of the people in our business do. If the
Kokóna will please to follow me I will show her the room
I have prepared.'</p>

<p>Zoë bent her head and followed, for the negress was
already leading the way. They entered a room of fair
dimensions which had evidently been got ready with
considerable care, for it contained everything that a
woman accustomed to comfort could require. A good
Persian carpet covered the floor; a narrow, but handsomely
chiselled bronze bedstead was furnished with two
mattresses, spotless linen, and a warm coverlet of silk and
wool; on a marble table stood a little mirror of polished
metal, before which lay two ivory combs and a number
of ivory and silver hairpins and other little things needful
for a woman's toilet; there stood also a gilt lamp
with three beaks, which shed a pleasant light upon
everything; a low curtained door at the end of the room
gave access to the small bathroom, where another little
lamp was burning. The negress drew the curtain back
and showed the place to Zoë, who had certainly not expected
to spend her first night of slavery in such luxurious
quarters. Rustan's wife opened a large wardrobe, too,
and showed her a plentiful supply of fine linen and clothes,
neatly folded and lying on shelves. In the middle of
the room a round table was prepared with three dishes,
one containing some small cold birds, another a salad,
and a third mixed sweetmeats, and there was also wine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
and water in small silver flagons, and one silver drinking-cup.
It was long indeed since Zoë had seen anything
like this, and her eyes smarted suddenly when she realised
that the slave-dealer's prison reminded her faintly
of her old home. For it was a prison after all; she
guessed that beyond the shutters of the closed window
there were stout iron bars, and as she had entered she
had seen a big key in the lock on the outside of the
door.</p>

<p>'It is late,' said the negress, when she had shown
everything. 'The girls will sleep on the floor, for the
carpet is good and there are two blankets for them, there
in the corner. Good-night, Kokóna. By what name
shall I call the Kokóna? The Kokóna will excuse her
servant's ignorance!'</p>

<p>Zoë hesitated a moment. She had not thought of
changing her name, but now she felt all at once that as a
slave she must cut off all connection with her former life.
What if the personage who was to buy her should turn
out to have known her mother, and even herself, and
should recognise her by her name? A resemblance of
face could be explained away, but her face and her name
together would certainly betray her. It was not so
much that she feared the open shame of being recognised
as Michael Rhangabé's adopted daughter; she
had grown used to the meaning of the word slavery
during those last desperate days. But people would not
fail to say that Kyría Agatha had sold her adopted daughter
into slavery in order to save herself and her own
children from misery. Zoë could prevent that, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
only hesitated long enough to choose the name by which
she was to be known.</p>

<p>'Call me Arethusa,' she said.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_081" id="i_081"></a>
<img src="images/i_081.jpg" width="402" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">'Yes,' replied the negress. 'Rustan is very affectionate. He says that I am his
Zoë, his "life," because he would surely die of starvation without me!'</p>
</div>

<p>Her thoughts had flown back to the deed of justice she
meant to do if she should ever be near the Emperor
Andronicus; and if Areté had come later to mean virtue,
it had meant courage first, manly, unflinching courage;
and as Zoë was only a Greek girl and not a German
professor, she naturally supposed that Areté was the
very word from which Arethusa was derived.</p>

<p>'It is a fine name,' observed her gaoler obsequiously.</p>

<p>'And what shall I call you?' asked Zoë.</p>

<p>'I am Kyría Karaboghazji.' The negress tossed her
flaming head and smiled with satisfied vanity. 'My husband
calls me Zoë,' she added, with an amazing smirk,
and some affectation of shyness.</p>

<p>'Zoë!' The high-born girl repeated her own name in
genuine astonishment.</p>

<p>'Yes,' replied the negress. 'Rustan is very affectionate.
He says that I am his Zoë, his "life," because he would
surely die of starvation without me!'</p>

<p>'I see,' said the Greek girl.</p>

<p>She would not have believed that before lying down in
her prison that night she would be forced to make an
effort to suppress a laugh.</p>

<p>'And now it is growing late,' said the negress again,
'and Rustan is wondering why I do not come to comb
his beard and smooth his pillow, and prepare his drink
for the night. Good-night, Kokóna Arethusa! May
Holy Charalambos send you dreams of delight!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>'And to you also, Kyría Karaboghazji,' Zoë answered,
though the form of the woman's salutation was new to
her.</p>

<p>The negress went out, still much pleased with herself,
and swaying her massive hips as she walked. She shut
the door, and Zoë heard the big key move in the
lock.</p>

<p>The two slave-girls had stood at a respectful distance
throughout the conversation, their hands crossed submissively
and their eyes bent on the floor, for Rustan's
wife had already taught them manners in order to improve
their price. But she was no sooner gone than they
looked at each other, and their lips began to twitch
nervously; in another moment they were both seized
with a convulsion of silent laughter. They shook from
head to foot, they held their sides, they bent and swayed,
and twisted their hands together, but not a sound escaped
their lips. Beyond this, they could not control
their mirth, and while they laughed they looked anxiously
at Zoë.</p>

<p>She herself could not help smiling when she thought
of the negress's enormous self-satisfaction, but presently
she shook her head at the girls and laid her finger on her
lips. Their amusement subsided quickly, for though she
seemed kind, they knew what they had to expect if one
word from her should expose them to the negress's
displeasure.</p>

<p>Zoë was very tired, now that the great sacrifice was
made, and she let the slave-girls help her as much as they
would. They even made her eat something and drink
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
a little water. Now and then, when they looked up at
her, she patted them on the shoulder and smiled faintly,
but her thoughts were far away in the ruined house in
the beggars' quarter. When the girls had helped her in
the bath and had dried her feet that had been stained
with mud and blue with the cold, they chafed them with
their hands and kissed them.</p>

<p>'They are like two little white mice!' said Yulia,
laughing softly.</p>

<p>'No, they are like young doves!' said Lucilla.</p>

<p>And they each slipped one of her feet into a slipper of
deerskin; and then they clothed her for the night, in
fine dry linen and a small green silk jacket. They were
skilful with their hands though they were still so young,
and she let them do what they thought she needed, and
lay down at last, to be covered and tucked in as warmly
and comfortably as when Kyría Agatha used to put her
to bed, before the boys had been born and had taken her
place.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the little maids had put out the lamp,
leaving only the small light in the bath; then they
noiselessly devoured all the sweetmeats left on the table,
after which they curled themselves upon the carpet under
their blankets and were asleep in a moment, like young
animals.</p>

<p>For a few moments Zoë still tried to think; tired
though she was, she hated herself for being able to rest
in such comfort while Kyría Agatha was perhaps awake
under her pile of rags, and Nectaria was hugging the
straw to keep a little warmth in her old body. But then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
she thought of the morrow, and of all that Nectaria
would do with the gold for the sick woman and the little
boys, and in this soothing reflexion she was borne softly
away out of this world of slavery, through the ivory gates
to the infinite gardens of dreamland.</p>

<p>She was waked by the sunshine streaming into the
room through the window, and as she opened her eyes
she saw the iron bars, and remembered where she was.
She sighed, for she had been happy in her sleep. The
girls were sitting cross-legged on the carpet, side by side,
at a little distance, silently awaiting her pleasure. She
turned her head on the pillow and lay on one side, looking
at their small dark faces; but she did not speak to
them yet. They were very much alike, she thought,
commonplace girls, differing so little from thousands of
other young slaves in the great city, that it would be
hard for her to recognise them, if she should not see
them for a few days. They would be disposed of soon,
of course, for there was always a demand for healthy
young house slaves who had been properly taught.
She envied them their homely features, their coarse
black hair, their angular figures, their sallow cheeks,
and their cunning little black eyes. They could only
be sold as workers. All her life Zoë had heard the
price of house-slaves discussed, even more freely than
the price of clothes or jewels, and she knew that
neither of the girls was worth more than five-and-twenty
ducats. She wondered what Rustan meant to
ask for herself; he would certainly not demand less
than double the sum he had paid.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>While she was reflecting on these questions, and wishing
all the time that she might have news of Kyría
Agatha during the day, the big key moved in the Persian
lock. The two girls sprang to their feet and stood in a
respectful attitude, Zoë turned her eyes as she heard
the sound, the door opened, and the negress's flaming head
appeared in the sunlight. She saw that Zoë was awake,
and she entered the room, shutting the door behind her.
She greeted her valuable prisoner in the half-familiar,
half-obsequious tone she had adopted from the first,
asking her how she had slept, and whether the little
maids had done their duty. The latter question was accompanied
by a fierce look at the two girls. Zoë answered
that they were most skilful and well behaved.
The negress looked at the remains of the supper on the
table.</p>

<p>'So the Kokóna Arethusa is fond of sweetmeats,'
she observed. 'She eats only a mouthful from one bird
and all the sugar-plums!'</p>

<p>Zoë was on the point of uttering an exclamation of
surprised denial, when she met the terrified eyes of the
two slave-girls and checked herself with a smile.</p>

<p>'I am very fond of sweets,' she answered carelessly.</p>

<p>The black woman seemed satisfied and turned from
the table. She opened the wardrobe next, and selected
what she considered the handsomest of the dresses that
lay folded on the shelves within. Zoë watched her
curiously. She unfolded garments of apple-green silk,
and one of peach-coloured Persian velvet embroidered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
with silver, with a sash of plaited green silk and gold
threads. The two girls took the things from her and
laid them out.</p>

<p>'Surely,' Zoë said, 'you do not wish me to wear those
clothes!'</p>

<p>'They are very good clothes,' observed the negress
coaxingly. 'Look at this velvet coat! There are even
seed-pearls in the embroidery, and it is quite new and
fresh. My husband bought it from the Blachernæ palace,
when Handsome John was imprisoned. It belonged to
one of the favourite ladies. The slaves who ran away
stole all the things and sold them.'</p>

<p>'I would rather wear something plainer,' said Zoë;
but at the mention of the captive Emperor her brown
eyes had grown very dark and hard, and her voice almost
trembled.</p>

<p>'Kokóna Arethusa must look her best this morning,'
objected Rustan's wife. 'She will receive a visit.'</p>

<p>Zoë started a little, and instinctively drew the bed-clothes
up to her chin.</p>

<p>'Already!' she exclaimed in a low tone.</p>

<p>The negress grinned from ear to ear.</p>

<p>'The Kokóna will perhaps not spend another night
under our humble roof,' she said. 'I do not know anything
certainly as yet, because the customer has not
seen you,' she continued more familiarly, 'but Rustan
has consulted the astrologer, who says that these are
fortunate days for our buying and our selling. So I
do not doubt but that the customer will be pleased with
your looks, Kokóna, for indeed, though I do not wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
to flatter you, we have not entertained such a beauty
in our modest home for a long time!'</p>

<p>All this was, of course, intended to put Zoë in a good
humour, in order that she might produce an agreeable
impression on the expected purchaser. Rustan had
once missed a very good bargain because the merchandise
had burst into tears at the wrong moment.</p>

<p>'What sort of person is the customer?' asked the girl.
'Do you know who he is?'</p>

<p>She asked the question quietly, but she held her breath
as she waited for the reply.</p>

<p>'I forget his name,' answered the negress after a
moment's thought. 'He is a foreigner, a rich young
merchant who lives in a fine house by the Golden
Horn.'</p>

<p>'A Christian, then?' Zoë asked, controlling her
voice.</p>

<p>The other pretended to be shocked.</p>

<p>'Does the Kokóna Arethusa believe that Rustan
would be so wicked as to sell a Christian maid to the
Turks? Rustan is a very devout man, Kokóna! He
would not do such an irreligious thing!'</p>

<p>Zoë remembered the allowance of three copper pennies
daily, and how he had driven her to sell herself for Kyría
Agatha's sake; but she did not care to impugn Rustan's
piety.</p>

<p>'So the astrologer says that I shall be sold to-day,'
she observed with an affectation of carelessness, though
her heart was sinking, and she felt a little sick. 'Is he
a great astrologer?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span></p>

<p>'He is Rustan's friend, Gorlias Pietrogliant,' answered
the negress, who was now turning over certain
fine linen in the wardrobe. 'Yes, he is a good star-gazer,
especially for merchants. He is very poor, but
many have grown rich through consulting him.'</p>

<p>She found what she wanted, and held up a beautifully
embroidered garment of linen as fine as a web.</p>

<p>'And if you are so fortunate as to go to the rich merchant's
house,' she added, 'you may win favour of him
by telling him to consult Gorlias about his affairs whenever
he is in doubt.'</p>

<p>'Gorlias.' Zoë repeated the name, for she had never
heard it.</p>

<p>'Gorlias Pietrogliant, who lives near the church of
Saint Sergius and Saint Bacchus. Every one in that
quarter knows him.'</p>

<p>'I shall remember,' Zoë said.</p>

<p>She understood at last why Rustan had been in the
habit of going often to that church, where she had been
kneeling in a dark corner when he had first seen her.
Thence he had followed her to the ruined house. But
she did not know that it was part of his regular business
to frequent the churches of the poorest quarters, because
it was there that starving girls were most often to
be seen, praying to heaven for the bread that so rarely
came from that direction. Many a good bargain had
Rustan made by following a poor little ragged figure
with a pretty face to a den of misery, and he was a perfect
expert in doling out alms until his victim yielded or was
forced to yield by her parents, for a handful of gold;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
nor has his method of conducting the business greatly
changed, even in our own day, excepting that the slave-dealers
themselves are mostly women now.</p>

<p>Having selected all the garments necessary for Zoë's
costume, the negress bade one of the slave-girls take away
the remains of the supper and bring what was already
prepared for the morning. The maid obeyed, and was
not gone two minutes. She brought in a bowl of
cherries, with white bread and butter and fresh water,
all on a polished tray of chiselled brass.</p>

<p>'Fruit is better for the health than sweetmeats
at this time of day,' observed the mistress of the house.
'By and by, at dinner, the Kokóna shall have all she
wishes.'</p>

<p>The little slaves looked at Zoë furtively and she
smiled.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she said, 'fruit is much better in the morning.'</p>

<p>Rustan's wife came and stood beside the bed and
scrutinised Zoë's face.</p>

<p>'I think,' she said critically, 'that as the customer is
a foreigner, it will be better not to paint your eyes.
The natural shadows under them are not bad.'</p>

<p>'I never painted my face in my life!' cried the girl,
rather indignantly.</p>

<p>'And the Kokóna is quite right!' answered the negress,
anxious to keep her in a good humour. 'Besides,' she
continued, fawning again, 'I am here only to do your
bidding and to wait on you to-day. Will it please you
to bathe now? I shall wait on you myself.'</p>

<p>'The little maids are very quick and clever,' objected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Zoë, who hardly looked upon the strapping African as a
woman.</p>

<p>'No doubt, Kokóna, but this is a part of our business,
and I do it better than they.'</p>

<p>'I would rather let them help me, if I must be helped,'
said Zoë. 'But, indeed, I am quite used to dressing
myself.'</p>

<p>'And pray,' argued the negress, grinning and growing
familiar again, 'how could Rustan give his customers
a written guarantee, unless I assured him, that there is
no cause for complaint, no blemish, no scar, no hidden
deformity, no ugly birthmark?'</p>

<p>Zoë turned her face away on the pillow.</p>

<p>'I had not thought of that,' she answered.</p>

<p>'Heaven forbid that I should myself,' returned the
woman, relapsing into her obsequious manner again,
'if it were not to save the young Kokóna from any trouble
or annoyance with our customer! If it will but please
her to call herself my mistress and me her slave, she shall
not be disappointed. If I am rough or clumsy she shall
box my ears whenever she pleases, and I shall not complain!'</p>

<p>The little maids devoutly wished that Zoë would avail
herself of their tyrant's extraordinary offer, but they
dared not smile. She still turned her face away and
was silent.</p>

<p>'See!' coaxed the African. 'I take off my coat!'
She suited the action to the word and divested herself
of her outer garment, which was the long coat and skirt
in one, worn only by free women. 'I cover my head, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
the Kokóna's presence!' She quickly flattened her
wild red hair under a kerchief which she knotted at the
back of her neck. 'I roll up my sleeves! Am I anything
but a slave, a bath-woman? Why will the beautiful
Kokóna not let me wait on her?'</p>

<p>Zoë turned her eyes and saw the change, and suddenly
her objection vanished; for Rustan's wife looked precisely
like the black slave-women who used to attend the
ladies in the Roman bath in Rhangabé's palace. The
association of ideas was so strong that the young girl
could not help smiling faintly.</p>

<p>'As you please,' she said, raising herself upon one hand
and preparing to get up.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p>Carlo Zeno's interview with Rustan had been short
and business-like, as has been said. It was indeed not
at all likely that a man of the Venetian's temper and
tastes would talk with a Bokharian slave-dealer a moment
longer than necessary.</p>

<p>Rustan, on hearing what was wanted, declared that
he had the very thing; in fact, by a wonderful coincidence,
it was the very thing in the acme of perfection,
a dream, a vision, fully worth four hundred ducats, and
certainly not to be sold for three hundred; it had fine
natural hair that had never been dyed; its teeth were
twenty-eight in number, the wisdom teeth not having
yet appeared, and Rustan would wager that Messer Carlo
could not find a single pearl in all Constantinople to
match one of those eight-and-twenty; its ankles were
so finely turned that a woman could span them with her
thumb and forefinger. Rustan felt safe in saying this,
for his black wife's huge hand could have spanned Zoë's
throat; also it had a most beautiful and slender waist,
which, as Messer Carlo remarked, was certainly a point
of beauty. Moreover, Rustan would deliver a signed
and sealed certificate with it.</p>

<p>For Zeno was conscientious, and held Marco Pesaro's
letter in his hand while he questioned the Bokharian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
in regard to the various points in succession, lest he
should forget any one of them. He did not in the least
believe a word that Rustan said, of course. The East
was never the land of simple, trusting faith between man
and man. He would even have wagered that Rustan
had nothing in his prison of the sort Pesaro wanted, and
at the moment of the interview he would have been quite
right. But he was tolerably sure that if he insisted on
having the best, the best to be had would be forthcoming
in a week at the utmost. Satisfied with this
prospect, he dismissed Rustan and thought no more
about the matter, except to wish that Marco Pesaro
had not troubled him with such an absurd commission.</p>

<p>A fine young gentleman of later times would probably
have thought few quests more amusing than this, and
would have dreamt that night of the beauties he intended
to see before at last deciding upon the purchase. Doubtless,
there were young Venetians even then in Constantinople
who would have envied Zeno the amusing task
of criticising pretty faces, hands, and ankles.</p>

<p>But he was not of the same temper or disposition as
those gay youths. He could not remember that any
woman had ever made a very profound impression on him,
even in his boyish days. When he was in Greece, it had
been suggested to him that he might as well marry, like
other young men, and he had allowed himself to be
betrothed to a sleepy Greek heiress who had conceived
an indolent but tenacious admiration for his fighting
qualities; but it had pleased the fates that she should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
die before the wedding-day of a complication of the spleen
superinduced by a surfeit of rose-leaf jam and honey-cakes.
He was rather ashamed to own to himself that
her translation to a better world had been a distinct
relief to his feelings, for he had soon discovered that he
did not love her, though he had been too kind to tell
her so, and too honourable to think of breaking his
promise of marriage.</p>

<p>He did not despise women either; indeed, his conduct
in the affair of his betrothal had proved that.
Now and then he had paused in his restless career to
think of a more peaceful life, and in the pictures that
rose before his imagination there was generally a woman.
Unhappily, he had never seen any one like her in real
life, and when he was tired of dreaming he shrugged his
shoulders at such impossibilities and went back to his
adventurous existence without a sigh. Yet it might
be thought that although he did not fall in love he might
now and then spend careless hours with the free and frail,
for he made no profession or show of austerity, and
whatever he really might be, he did not aspire to be
called a saint. He had been a wild student in Padua
once, and had drunk deep and played high, until he
had suddenly grown tired of stupid dissipation and had
left the dice to play the more exciting game of life and
death as a soldier of fortune under a condottiere, during
five long wandering years. But at the core of his nature
there was something ascetic which his comrades could
never understand, and at which they laughed when he
was not within hearing; for he was an evil man to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
quarrel with, as they had found out. He never killed
his man in a duel if he could help it, but he had a way
of leaving his mark for life on his adversary's face
which few cared to risk.</p>

<p>And now it was long indeed since his lips had touched
a woman's, for his character had taken its final manly
shape, and the only folly to which he still yielded now
and then was that of risking his life recklessly whenever
he fancied that a cause was worth it; but this he did
not look upon as madness, still less as weakness, and
there was no one to argue the question with him. His
honest brown eyes softened sometimes, almost like a
woman's, but only for pity or kindness, never for word
or look of love.</p>

<p>He rose in the bright spring morning just before the
sun was up, and went down the steps at the water's
edge below his house and swam far out in clear water
that was still icy cold. Then he dressed himself completely
as strong and healthy men do, who hate to feel
that they are not ready to face anything from the beginning
of the day. But while he was dressing he was not
thinking of the errand that was to take him to Rustan's
house an hour before noon. Indeed, he had quite forgotten
it, till he saw Omobono folding Pesaro's letter
in his neat way in order to file it for reference. As
the secretary knew what it contained, and had been
actively employed in the matter to which it referred,
he had thought there could be no great sin of curiosity
in reading it carefully while his master was at his toilet.
It would have been wrong, he thought, to find out what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
was in it before Zeno himself had broken the seal, but
since it was open, it was evidently better that the secretary
should understand precisely what was wanted of
his employer, for such knowledge could only increase
his own usefulness. For the rest, he vaguely hoped that
Zeno would take him into close confidence and ask his
opinion of any merchandise he thought of buying; for
Omobono had a high opinion of his own taste in beauty,
and had wished to pass for a lively spark in his young
days.</p>

<p>But Zeno evidently considered himself qualified to
decide the matter without help, for when it lacked an
hour of noon he set his secretary at work on a fair copy
of a letter he had been preparing, ordered his horse and
running footman, and went upon his errand without any
other attendant or companion. Omobono looked out
of the window and watched him as he mounted, innocently
envying him his youth and strength. The greatest
fighting man of his century moved as such men generally
do, without haste and without effort, never wasting a
movement and never making an awkward one, never
taking a fine attitude for the sake of effect, as the young
men of Raphael's pictures so often seem to be doing,
but always and everywhere unconsciously graceful,
self-possessed, and ready for anything.</p>

<p>He rode a half-bred brown Arab mare, for he was not
a heavy man, and he preferred a serviceable mount at all
times to the showy and ill-tempered white Barbary,
or the rather delicate thoroughbred of the desert, which
were favourites with the rich Greeks of Constantinople.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
He was quietly dressed, too; and his bare-legged runner,
who cleared the way for him when the streets were
crowded, wore a plain brown tunic and cap, and did not
yell at the poorer people and slaves or strike them in
passing as the footmen of great personages always did.
Zeno had picked him out of at least a hundred for his
endurance and his long wind.</p>

<p>So they went quietly and quickly along, the man and
his master, following very nearly the way which Omobono
had taken on the previous afternoon, till they came
to the long wall crested with sharp bits of rusty iron and
broken crockery, and stopped before the only door that
broke its blank length. Zeno looked at the defence
critically, and wondered just how great an inducement
would make him take the trouble of getting over it, at
the risk of cutting his hands and tearing his clothes.
Before any one answered his footman's knock, he had
decided that it would be an easy matter to bring his
well-broken horse close to the wall, to stand on the saddle,
draw himself up and throw a heavy cloak over the spiky
iron and the sharp-edged shards with one hand while
hanging by the other. The rest would be easy enough.
It was always his instinct to make such calculations
when he entered or passed by any place that was meant
to be defended.</p>

<p>This time the door was opened by Rustan Karaboghazji
in person, and he bowed to the ground as Zeno got off
his horse and stood beside him. Still bending low he
made way and with a wide gesture invited his visitor
to enter. But Zeno had no intention of wasting time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
by going in till he was assured that there was something
ready for his inspection in the way of merchandise.</p>

<p>In answer to his question Rustan turned up his face
sideways and smiled cunningly as he gradually straightened
himself.</p>

<p>'Your Magnificence shall see!' he answered. 'Where
is the letter? Every point is perfect, as I promised.'</p>

<p>'Were you really speaking the truth?' laughed Zeno.
'I expected to come at least three times before seeing
anything!'</p>

<p>Rustan assumed an expression of gentle reproach.</p>

<p>'If your Splendour had dealt with Barlaam, the Syrian
merchant, or with Abraham of Smyrna, the Jewish caravan-broker,'
he said, 'it would have been as your Greatness
deigns to suggest. Moreover, your Highness would not
have been satisfied after all, and would have come at last
to the house of your servant Rustan Karaboghazji, surnamed
the Truth-speaker and the Just, and also the
Keeper of Promises, by those who know him. It must
have been so, since there is but one treasure in all the
Empire such as your Mightiness asks for, and it is in
this house.'</p>

<p>Zeno laughed carelessly, and entered.</p>

<p>'Your Unspeakableness is amused,' said Rustan,
fastening the outer door carefully with both keys. 'But
if it is not as I say, I entreat your High Mightiness to
kick his humble servant from this door to the Seven
Towers and back again, passing by the Chora, Blachernæ,
and the Church of the Blessed Pantokrator on the way.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<p>'That would take a long time,' observed Zeno. 'Open
the door and let me see the girl.'</p>

<p>'Your Grandeur shall see, indeed!' answered Rustan,
smiling confidently as he led the way. 'Rustan the
Truth-speaker,' he continued, as if to himself while walking,
'Karaboghazji the faithful Keeper of Promises!'</p>

<p>He gently caressed his beautiful black beard as he
went on. He took Zeno through the small part of the
house which he reserved for his own use, far from the
larger rooms where he kept his stock of slaves. In an
inner apartment they met the negress, resplendent in
scarlet velvet and a heavy gold chain, her red hair
combed straight out from her head. When Zeno appeared,
she at once assumed what she considered a modest
but engaging attitude, crossing her great hands upon
her splendid coat, and looking down with a marvellous
attempt at a simper.</p>

<p>Rustan stood still and for a moment Zeno thought
that the dealer had ventured to jest with him, by showing
him the terrific negress in her finery as the incomparable
treasure of which he had spoken. But Rustan's words
explained everything.</p>

<p>'My Life,' he said, speaking to his wife in a caressing
tone, 'is the girl ready to be seen?'</p>

<p>'As my lord commanded me,' replied the negress,
keeping her hands folded and bending a little.</p>

<p>'This lady,' said Rustan to Zeno, 'is my wife, and
my right hand.' He turned to her. 'Sweet Dove,'
he said, 'pray lead his Magnificence to the slave's room.
I will wait here.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>Zeno seemed surprised at this arrangement.</p>

<p>'My wife' explained Rustan, 'understands the creatures
better than I. My business is buying and selling;
it is her part to keep the merchandise in good condition,
and to show it to the customers who honour us.'</p>

<p>He smiled pleasantly as he said this, and remained
standing while Zeno followed the negress out of the room.
As he walked behind her he could not help noting her
strong square shoulders, and the swing of her powerful
hips, and her firm tread, and he conceived the idea that
she would be a match for any ordinary man in a tussle.
He was certainly not thinking of the slave-girl he was
about to inspect.</p>

<p>Another door opened, and he was in a room flooded
with sunshine and sweet with spring flowers; he stopped,
and unconsciously drew one sharp breath of surprise.
Zoë had been sitting in a big chair in the sun, and had
half risen as the door opened, her hand resting on one
of the arms of the seat. Her eyes met Zeno's, and for
a moment no one moved. If Rustan had been present
he would have raised the price of the merchandise to
five hundred ducats at least; the black woman only
grinned, well pleased with the appearance of the girl
whom she had herself dressed to receive the customer's
visit of inspection.</p>

<p>Zoë's hand tightened a little on the arm of the chair and
she sank quietly into her seat again as she turned her
eyes from Zeno's face, forgetting that she had promised
herself to stand erect and cold as a slave should when she
is being exhibited.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>If the Venetian still doubted that by some mysterious
chance of fate the girl he had come to buy at the slave-dealer's
was as well born as himself, her movement as
she sat down dispelled his lingering uncertainty. He had
entered the room carelessly, still wearing his cap. As
Zoë resumed her seat, he took it from his head, bowing
instinctively, as he would have done on meeting a woman
of his own class. A faint colour rose in the girl's cheeks,
as she looked at him again.</p>

<p>Rustan's wife laughed silently, standing a little behind
him. Zoë spoke first.</p>

<p>'Pray, sir,' she said, 'be covered.'</p>

<p>'His High Mightiness uncovers his head for coolness,'
said the negress.</p>

<p>Zeno gave her a sharp glance and then turned to Zoë.</p>

<p>'It is not possible that you are a slave,' he said, coming
a little nearer and looking down into her face.</p>

<p>But she would not meet his eyes.</p>

<p>'It is the truth, sir,' she said. 'I am a slave and any
one may buy me and take me away.'</p>

<p>'Then you have been carried off by force,' Zeno answered
with conviction, 'in war, perhaps, or in some raid
of enemies on enemies. Tell me who you are and how
it happened, and by the body of blessed Saint Mark,
I will give you back free to your own people!'</p>

<p>Zoë looked at him in silent surprise. The negress
answered him at once, for she did not like the turn affairs
were taking, and though she had never heard of Carlo
Zeno, she judged from his looks that he was able to make
good his promise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span></p>

<p>'Your Splendour does not really believe that my husband
would risk the punishment of a robber for carrying
off a free woman!' she cried.</p>

<p>'I am a slave,' Zoë said quietly. 'Only a slave and
nothing else. There is no more than that to tell.'</p>

<p>She drew one hand across her brow and eyes as if to
shut out something or to drive it away. Zeno came
nearer and stood alone beside her.</p>

<p>'Tell me your story,' he said in a lower tone. 'Do not
be afraid! no one shall hurt you.'</p>

<p>'There is no more to tell,' she repeated, shaking her
head. 'But you are kind, and I thank you very much.'</p>

<p>She raised her clear brown eyes gratefully to his for a
moment. There was sadness in them, but he saw that
she had not been weeping; and like a man, he argued
that if she were very unhappy she would, of course, shed
copious tears the live-long day, like the captive maidens
in the tales of chivalry. He looked at the beautiful
young hand, now lying on the arm of the chair, and for
the first time in his life he felt embarrassed.</p>

<p>The negress, who was not at all used to such methods
in the buying and selling of humanity, now came forward
and began to call attention to the fine quality of her goods.</p>

<p>'Very fine natural hair,' she observed. 'Your Gorgeousness
will see at once that it has never been dyed.'</p>

<p>She took one of Zoë's plaits in her hand, and the girl
shrank a little at the touch.</p>

<p>'Let her alone!' Zeno said sharply. 'I am not blind.'</p>

<p>'It is her business to show me,' Zoë answered for her,
in a tone of submission.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_105" id="i_105"></a>
<img src="images/i_105.jpg" width="389" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">'Tell me your story,' he said in a lower tone. 'Do not be afraid! no one shall
hurt you.'</p>
</div>

<p>'It shall not be her business much longer,' replied
Zeno, almost to himself.</p>

<p>He suddenly turned away from her, went to the open
window, and looked out, laying one hand on the iron
bars. It was not often that he hesitated, but he found
himself faced by a very unexpected difficulty. He was
executing a commission for a friend, and if he bought
a slave with his friend's money, he should feel bound in
honour to send her to her new master at the first opportunity.
On the other hand, though it was perfectly
clear from the girl's behaviour that she expected no better
fate, he was intimately convinced that in some way a
great wrong was being done, and he had never yet passed
a wrong by without trying to right it with his purse or
his sword. Clearly, he was still at liberty to buy Zoë
for himself, and take her to his home; yet he shrank
from such a solution of the problem, as if it were the
hardest of all. What should he do with a young and
lovely girl in his house, where there were no women, where
no woman ever set foot? She would need female attendants,
and of course he could buy them for her, or
hire them; but he thought with strong distaste of such
an establishment as all this would force upon him. Besides,
he could not keep the girl for ever, merely because
he suspected that she was born a lady and was the victim
of some great injustice. She denied that she was.
What if she should persist in her denial after he had
bought her to set her free? What if she really had no
family, no home, no one to whom she could go, or wished
to go? He would not turn her out, then; he would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
sell her again, and he should not want her. Moreover,
he knew well enough that it was not his nature to go on
leading the peaceful life of a merchant much longer,
even if the threatening times would permit it. He had
always been as free as air. As he was now living, if it
should please him to leave Constantinople, he could do
so in twenty-four hours, leaving his business, though
at a loss, to another merchant&mdash;for he had prospered.
But it would be otherwise if this girl were in the house,
under his protection, and it never occurred to him, after
he had looked into her eyes, that she could live under his
roof except in order that he might protect her&mdash;protect
her from imaginary enemies, right imaginary wrongs
she had never suffered, and altogether make of her what
she protested that she was not.</p>

<p>It was absurd to think of such a thing, and having
come to this conclusion in a shorter time than it has
taken me to describe his thoughts, he turned abruptly
with the intention of buying her for Marco Pesaro's
account.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, when he saw her face he could not
do it.</p>

<p>'I will send a palanquin for you in an hour,' he said
hurriedly, and he made for the door in evident anxiety
to get away without exchanging another word with Zoë.</p>

<p>The negress followed him quickly into the next room,
very much surprised at his way of doing business.</p>

<p>'If it please your Glory,' she began, overtaking him
with difficulty, but he would not listen, and hurried on.</p>

<p>'I will settle with Rustan,' he said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<p>But in the room where he had left her, Zoë was leaning
back in her chair alone, gazing at the sunlit window. At
that very moment, so far as she knew, the gold was being
counted out that was the price of her young life. In an
hour she would be taken away in a closed litter, as she
had been brought last night, she would be carried into
another house, the slide would slip back, and she would
be told to get down.</p>

<p>The voice would be a man's. Who was he? What
was his name? What was she to be to him? He was
a Venetian, she guessed by his dress, and she felt that his
blood was gentle, like her own. But that was all,
though she was already his property. It was dreadful;
or, at least, it should be dreadful to think of! She felt
that she ought to long for death now, a thousand times
more earnestly than last night.</p>

<p>But she did not. For she was a most womanly woman
already, though not nineteen, and there are few women
of that intensely feminine temper who cannot judge at a
first meeting with a man whether they can gain power
over him or not. Moreover, this strength is greatest
with men who are most profoundly masculine, because
it is not the influence of one character over another, but
the deeper, stronger, more mysterious power of sex
over sex.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p>Little Omobono's thin legs carried him up and down
the stairs of Zeno's house at an astonishing pace during
the next hour; for Carlo gave fifty orders, every one
of which he insisted should be executed at once. It was
not a small thing to instal a woman luxuriously in a
house in which no woman had set foot since Carlo had
lived there, and to do this within sixty minutes. It is
true that the rich young merchant had great store of
thick carpets and fine stuffs, and all sorts of silver vessels,
and weapons from Damascus, and carved ivory chessmen
from India; but though some of these things quickly
furnished the upper rooms which Zeno set apart for the
valuable slave's use while she remained under his roof,
yet scimitars, chessmen, and heathen idols of jade were
poor substitutes for all the things a woman might be
expected to need at a moment's notice, from hairpins and
hand-mirrors to fine linen pillow-cases, sweetmeats, and a
lap-dog. Zeno's ideas of a woman's requirements were a
little vague, but he determined that Zoë should want
nothing, and he charged Omobono with the minute
execution of his smallest commands.</p>

<p>He himself lived simply and almost rudely. He
slept on a small hard divan with a little hard cushion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
under his head, and a cloak to cover him in cold weather.
He hated hot water, scented soap, and all the soft luxuries
of the Roman bath. There was no mirror in his
room, no elaborate toilet service of gold and silver, such
as fine young gentlemen used even then. He liked a good
dinner when he was hungry, good wine when he was
thirsty, and a wide easy-chair when he had worked
all day; but it never had cost him a moment's discomfort
to exchange such a home as he now lived in for the
camp or the sea.</p>

<p>Women were different beings, however, so he made all
allowances for them, and went to extreme lengths in
estimating their necessities, as Omobono found to his
cost. Yet with all his preoccupation for details, Zeno
forgot that Zoë must have a woman to wait on her at
once, and when he realised the omission, almost at the
last minute, the future conqueror of the Genoese, the
terror of the Mediterranean, the victorious general of
the Paduan campaign, the hero of thirty pitched battles
and a score of sea-fights, felt his heart sink with something
like fear. What would have happened if he had
not remembered just in time that Marco Pesaro's slave
must have a maid? She should have two, or three, or
as many as she needed.</p>

<p>'Omobono,' he said, as the little secretary came up
the stairs for the twentieth time, 'go out quickly and buy
two maids. They must be young, healthy, clean, clever,
and silent. Lose no time!'</p>

<p>'Two maids?' The secretary's jaw dropped. 'Two
maids?' he repeated almost stupidly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes. Is there anything wonderful in that? Did
you expect to wait on the lady yourself?'</p>

<p>'The lady?' Omobono opened his little eyes very wide.</p>

<p>'I mean,' answered Zeno, correcting himself, 'the&mdash;the
young person who is going to be lodged here. Lose
no time, I say! Go as fast as you can!'</p>

<p>Omobono turned and went, not having the least idea
where to go. Before he had reached the outer door,
Zeno called after him down the stairs.</p>

<p>'Stop!' cried the merchant. 'It is too late. You
must go and get the lady&mdash;the young person. Take
two palanquins instead of one, and tell Rustan to let
her choose her own slaves. You can put the two into
one litter and bring them all together.'</p>

<p>'But the price, sir?' enquired Omobono, who was a
man of business. 'Rustan will ask what he pleases if I
take him such a message!'</p>

<p>'Tell him that if he is not reasonable he shall do no
more business with Venetians,' answered Zeno, from
the head of the marble stairs.</p>

<p>Omobono nodded obediently and followed his instructions.
So it came to pass that before long he found
himself within Rustan's outer wall with two palanquins
and eight bearers, besides a couple of Zeno's trusty
men-servants, well armed, for he carried a large sum of
money in gold. The Bokharian and the secretary went
into an inner room to count and weigh the ducats, but
before this began Omobono delivered his message in full.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_113" id="i_113"></a>
<img src="images/i_113.jpg" width="497" height="402" alt="" />
<p class="caption">'Forty ducats!' cried Omobono, casting up his eyes, and preparing to bargain for at least half an hour.</p>
</div>

<p>'I have the very thing,' said Karaboghazji. 'There are
two girls who have waited on her and with whom she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
much pleased. As for asking too high a price, forty
ducats for the two is nothing. They are a gift, at that.'</p>

<p>'Forty ducats!' cried Omobono, casting up his eyes,
and preparing to bargain for at least half an hour.</p>

<p>'If it is dear,' said Rustan, his face becoming like stone,
'may my tongue never speak the truth again!'</p>

<p>Considering attentively the consequences of such an
awful fate Omobono did not think that the Bokharian
risked any great inconvenience if the imprecation should
take effect.</p>

<p>'It is far from me,' said the secretary, 'to suggest
that your words are not literally true, according to your
own light. But you must be aware that the price of
maid-servants has fallen much since yesterday, owing
to the arrival of a shipload of them from Tanais.'</p>

<p>Rustan shook his head and maintained his stony
expression.</p>

<p>'They are worthless,' he said. 'Do you suppose I
should not have bought the best of them? There has
been a plague of smallpox in their country, and they are
all pitted. They are as oranges, blighted by hail.'</p>

<p>As Omobono had invented the ship and its cargo,
he found it hard to refute Rustan's argument, which
was quite as good as his own.</p>

<p>'May my fingers be turned round in their sockets and
close on the back of my hand, if I have asked one ducat
too much,' said the Bokharian with stolid calm.</p>

<p>Omobono hesitated, for a new idea had struck him.
Before he could answer, a door opened and Rustan's
wife, who had put off her finery, ushered in Zoë, closely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
veiled and wrapped in the cloak she had worn on the
previous night. It was, in fact, necessary that she
should be delivered up in return for the gold, and the
negress had supposed that the counting was almost over.</p>

<p>'My turtle dove,' said Rustan in dulcet tones, 'fetch
those two girls who have waited on Kokóna Arethusa.
The Venetian merchant will buy them for her.'</p>

<p>The negress grinned and went out. By this time
Omobono had made up his mind what to say.</p>

<p>'My dear sir,' he began, in a conciliatory tone, consider
that we are friends, and do not ask an exorbitant
price. I beseech you to be obliging, by four toes and
five toes.'</p>

<p>Omobono wondered what would happen after he had
pronounced the mysterious words. Rustan looked
keenly at him and was silent for a moment. Neither
of them noticed that Zoë made a quick movement as she
stood by the table between them. The Bokharian rose
suddenly and went to shut the door.</p>

<p>'Where?' he asked as he crossed the small room.</p>

<p>Omobono's face fell at the unexpected and apparently
irrelevant question. Instantly Zoë bent down and
whispered three words in his ear. Before Rustan turned
back to hear the clerk's answer, she was standing
erect and motionless again, and he did not suspect that
she had moved.</p>

<p>'Over the water,' answered Omobono, with perfect
confidence.</p>

<p>'You may have the two for four-and-twenty ducats,'
said Rustan. 'But you cannot expect me to take anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
off the price of the Kokóna,' he added. 'I bargained
with your master, and he agreed.'</p>

<p>'No, no! Certainly! And I thank you, sir.'</p>

<p>'I suppose,' said Rustan, 'that you would do as much
for me.'</p>

<p>'Of course, of course,' answered Omobono. 'Shall
we count the ducats?'</p>

<p>When the operation was almost finished, the negress returned
with the two slave-girls, whose commonplace features
were wreathed in smiles, and they began to kiss the
hem of Zoë's cloak. Omobono inspected them critically.</p>

<p>'Are you pleased with them, Kokóna?' he enquired
of Zoë. 'My master is very anxious that you should
be satisfied.'</p>

<p>'Indeed I am,' Zoë answered readily. 'They are very
clever little maids.'</p>

<p>The two were almost crying with delight, and only
a meaning movement of the negress's hand to her girdle
checked them. They were not out of her power yet.
Omobono eyed them, and really thought them cheap at
twelve ducats each, as indeed they were. He was paying
four hundred for Zoë, but Rustan did not mean her to see
the gold, and had covered it with one of his loose sleeves
as she entered. He now begged his wife take the three
slaves to the palanquins while he finished counting and
weighing, and wrote out his receipt for the money.
He called the negress his pet mouse, his little bird, and
the down-quilted waistcoat of his heart, and but for her
terrific appearance, and the weapon she carried in her
girdle, Omobono would have laughed outright.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>Rustan wrote on a strip of parchment, in bad
Greek:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>Omobono observed that the receipt acknowledged
forty ducats as the price of the two girls, instead of
twenty-four.</p>

<p>'Rustan Karaboghazji, surnamed the Truth-speaker,
does not sell slaves at twelve ducats,' answered the Bokharian
with dignity. 'Moreover, your employer will
see that he has paid forty, and you can justly keep the
sixteen ducats for yourself.'</p>

<p>'That would not be honest,' protested Omobono,
shaking his neat grey beard.</p>

<p>Rustan smiled, in a pitying way.</p>

<p>'You Venetians do not really understand business,'
he said, tightening the strings of the canvas bag into
which he had swept the gold, and knotting them as he
rose.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Omobono was trudging along after
the two palanquins, wondering much at certain things
that had happened to him during the last twenty-four
hours and less. For he was curious, as you know, and
it irritated him to feel that something was going on
in the world, all about him and near him, of which
he could not even guess the nature, manifesting itself
in such nonsensical phrases as 'four toes and five toes,'
and 'over the water,' which nevertheless produced
such truly astonishing results. Since the previous
afternoon he had met four persons who knew those
absurd words,&mdash;the negress, her Bokharian husband, the
sacristan to Saints Sergius and Bacchus, and a Greek
slave-girl, whom he was far from recognising as the
beautiful creature he had seen yesterday in the ruined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
house in the beggars' quarter. She was so closely veiled
to-day that he could not in the least guess what her face
was like.</p>

<p>Since she not only knew the first password, but had
whispered the second to him, he wondered why she had
not used her knowledge to get her freedom. It was
incredible that the people who knew the words should
not be banded together in some secret brotherhood; but
if they were brethren, how could they sell one another
into slavery? Omobono was so much interested in
these problems that he did not see where he was till
the leading palanquin entered Zeno's gate.</p>

<p>Zeno himself was not to be seen. The servant at
the door gave Omobono a slip of cotton paper on which
the merchant had written an order. The secretary was
to take his charges to what was now the women's apartment
and leave them there. Zoë obeyed Omobono's
directions in silence, still veiled, and the two maids
tripped up the marble stairs after her, as happy as birds
on a May morning, and taking in all they saw with
wondering eyes; for they had never been in a fine house
before.</p>

<p>'This is the Kokóna's apartment,' Omobono said,
standing aside to let Zoë pass. 'If the Kokóna desires
anything, she will please to send one of her maids to
me. I am the master's secretary.'</p>

<p>He had been surprised when Zeno spoke of her as
a 'lady,' but somehow, since she had whispered in his
ear at the slave-dealer's house, and since he had seen
her movement and carriage when she walked upstairs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
he instinctively treated her and spoke to her as if she were
his superior. She nodded her thanks now, but said
nothing, and he went away. She looked after him and
listened, but no key was turned after the door was closed,
and she heard only his retreating steps on the marble
stairs. Then she turned to the window, which was open,
and she threw aside her veil and looked out upon the
Golden Horn.</p>

<p>The two little maids at once began a minute examination
of the rooms, which occupied more than half
the upper story of the house, and were, if anything, too
crowded with rich furniture, with divans, carved tables,
hanging lamps, cushioned seats, and pillows of every
size, shape, and colour. There were handsome wardrobes,
too, full of the fine clothes Zoë was to wear.
The girls touched everything and talked by signs, lest
they should disturb Zoë's meditations. They told each
other that the master of the house must be highly pleased
with his slave, since he surrounded her with beautiful
things; that these things were all new, which was a sign
that there was no other woman in the house; and that
they were very fortunate and happy to have been sold,
after only a month of apprenticeship under the negress's
merciless training. They also explained to each other
that they were hungry, for it was past noon. The idea
of running away had probably never occurred to either
of them, even in Rustan's house. Where should they
go? And besides, the fate of runaway slaves was before
their eyes.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Zeno sat in his balconied room alone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
Omobono had delivered the receipt and had simply told
him that sixteen ducats had been saved on the bargain,
though Rustan did not wish it known. Thereupon Zeno
gave the secretary a couple of ducats for himself, which
Omobono saw no reason for not taking.</p>

<p>Zeno was preoccupied and chose to be alone, so he
dismissed his secretary with injunctions to rest after
the labour of installing the new arrival, which had not
been light, and he walked up and down his room in deep
thought. He had acted on an impulse altogether against
his own judgment, and now he was faced by the unpleasant
necessity of justifying his conduct in his own
eyes.</p>

<p>One thing was quite clear; so long as he did not draw
from the house of Cornèr the money which Marco Pesaro
had sent to the banker for the commission, the merchandise
was his property, since he had paid for it.
But he must make up his mind whether he meant to call
it his own, or not. If he decided to keep Arethusa, he
must at once set about finding another slave for Marco
Pesaro, or else write to say that he declined to execute
the commission.</p>

<p>In that case, Arethusa remained his. The reason why
he had so suddenly determined to buy her was that he
fancied she was a girl of good family whom some great
misfortune had brought into her present distress. But
she had calmly declared that she was a slave, and expected
nothing better than to be sold.</p>

<p>If this were true he had paid four hundred ducats for
a foolish fancy. She was perhaps the child of some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
beautiful slave, and had been carefully educated by her
mother's owner; and the latter, needing money perhaps,
had sent her to the market; or perhaps he had
died and his heirs were selling his property.</p>

<p>All this was very unsatisfactory. If she was slave-born,
Zeno's best course was to send Arethusa to Pesaro,
as soon as the Venetian ship sailed, for he had not the
least intention of wasting money in a futile attempt to
free slaves whom the law regarded as born to their
condition. Their position was a misfortune, no doubt,
but they were used to it, and no one had then dreamed
of man's inherent right of freedom, excepting one or two
popes and fanatics who had been considered visionaries.
To Zeno, who was a man of his own times, it seemed quite
as absurd that every one should be born free, as it would
seem to you that everybody should be born an English
duke, a Tammany boss, a great opera tenor, or Crown
Prince of the Empire. Moreover, in the case of a beauty,
especially of one sold to live in Venice, there were palliations,
as Zeno knew. Arethusa would live in luxury;
she would also soon be the real dominant in Marco
Pesaro's household, as favourite slaves very generally
were in the palaces of those who owned them. They
had not yet all the vast influence in Venice which they
gained in the following century, but their power was
already waxing balefully.</p>

<p>Zeno did not hesitate long; he never did, and when he
had made up his mind he sent for one of Arethusa's maids.</p>

<p>'What is your name, child?' he asked, scrutinising
the girl's commonplace features and intelligent eyes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>'Yulia, Magnificence,' she answered. 'If it please you,'
she added diffidently, as if half-expecting that he would
choose to call her something else.</p>

<p>'Yulia,' repeated Zeno, fixing the name in his memory,
'and what do you call your mistress?' he asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>The girl was puzzled by the question.</p>

<p>'Her name is Arethusa,' she answered, after a moment's
reflection.</p>

<p>'I know that. But when you speak to her, what do
you call her? When she gives you an order, how do you
answer her? You do not merely say, "Yes, Arethusa,"
or "No, Arethusa," do you? She would not be pleased.'</p>

<p>Yulia smiled and shook her head.</p>

<p>'We call her Kokóna,' she answered. 'Is not that
the Greek word for young lady, your Magnificence?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said Zeno, 'that is the Greek word for young
lady. But Arethusa is only a slave as you are. Why
do you give her a title? What makes you think she
is a lady?'</p>

<p>'She is a different kind of slave. She cost much gold.
Besides, if we did not call her Kokóna she would perhaps
pull our hair or scratch our faces. Who knows? We
are only ignorant little maids, but so much the big
negress at the slave-prison taught us.'</p>

<p>'She taught you manners, did she?' Zeno smiled at
the idea.</p>

<p>'She made us cry very often, but it was the better for
us,' answered the maid, with philosophy beyond her
years. 'We have fetched a good price, and we have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
a good master, and we are together, all because we waited
cleverly on the Kokóna one night and one morning.'</p>

<p>'One night?' asked Zeno, in surprise.</p>

<p>'She was only brought to the slave-prison yesterday
evening, Magnificence.'</p>

<p>'At what time?'</p>

<p>'It was the third hour of darkness, for the black
woman sent the others to bed as soon as she was brought.'</p>

<p>Zeno thought over this information for a moment.</p>

<p>'Tell her,' said he, 'that I shall sup with her this
evening. That is all.'</p>

<p>Yulia, who had kept her hands respectfully before her,
made a little obeisance, turned quickly, and ran away,
leaving the master of the house to his meditations.
She found Zoë still sitting by the window, and the
dainty dishes which Lucilla had received on a chiselled
bronze tray and had placed beside her were untasted.</p>

<p>'The master bids me say that he will sup with you
to-night, Kokóna,' said Yulia.</p>

<p>Zoë made a slight movement, but controlled herself,
and said nothing, though the colour rose to her face,
and she turned quite away from the maids lest they
should see it. They stood still a long time, waiting
her pleasure.</p>

<p>'Will it not please you to eat something?' asked Yulia
timidly, after a time. 'You have eaten nothing since
last night, and even then it was little.'</p>

<p>'I thought I ate all the sweetmeats,' answered Zoë,
turning and smiling a little at the recollection of the
girls' terror.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span></p>

<p>The hours passed and nothing happened. Some time
after dinner she saw from her upper window that Zeno
came out of the house and went down the marble steps to
a beautiful skiff that was waiting there. As he stepped
in, she drew far back from the window lest he should
look up and see that she had been watching him. She
heard his voice as he gave an order to the two watermen;
their oars fell with a gentle plash, and when she
looked again they were pulling the boat away upstream,
towards the palace of Blachernæ and the Sweet Waters.</p>

<p>The maids, having eaten of the most delicious food
they had ever tasted till they could eat no more, had
curled themselves up together on a carpet not far from
their mistress, and were fast asleep. The shadow of the
house lengthened till it slanted out to the right beyond
the marble steps upon the placid water, and the bright
sunlight that fell on Pera and Galata began to turn
golden; so, when gold has been melted to white heat in
the crucible, it begins to cool, grows tawny, and is shot
with streaks of red.</p>

<p>As the day waned in a purple haze and the air grew
colder, the two maids awoke together, rubbed their eyes,
and instantly sprung to their feet. Zoë had not even
noticed them, but just then the even plashing of oars
was heard again, and she saw the skiff coming back, but
without Zeno. She looked again to be sure that it was
the same boat, and a ray of hope flashed in her thoughts
like summer lightning. Perhaps he had changed his
mind, and would not come&mdash;not to-night.</p>

<p>The maids reminded her of his message, and she let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
them dress her again for the evening. They arranged
her hair, and twined strings of pearls in it, which they had
found in a sandal-wood box on the dressing-table. They
took clothes from the wardrobes, fine linen, wrought with
wonderful needlework, and pale silks, and velvet of
faintest blue embroidered with silver threads; and when
they had done their best they held two burnished metal
mirrors before her and behind her, that she might admire
herself. They had lighted many little lamps that
were all prepared, for it was now dark out of doors, and
they had spent two hours in arraying Zoë. And she
smiled and patted their cheeks, and called them clever
girls, for she was sure that Zeno had changed his mind.
He would not come to her to-night.</p>

<p>But even as she repeated the words to herself, he came
softly through the warm lamplight and stood before her,
and her heart stopped beating.</p>

<p>For the first time since she had taken the final step,
she felt the whole extent and meaning of what she had
done. She was really a slave, and she was alone with
her master.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p>'Are you afraid of me?'</p>

<p>Zeno asked the question gently, for the colour had
left her face; and she looked up at him with a frightened
stare. He had once seen a like terror in the eyes of a
startled doe, as if a clouded opal passed across its sight.</p>

<p>Zoë did not answer, but she moved instinctively,
drawing herself together, as it were, and turning one
shoulder to him. He heard her breathing hard.</p>

<p>It was a very new thing that he felt; for often, in
fight, and often again, he had seen strong men turn pale
before him, just when they felt that he was a master of
the sword and was going to kill, but he had never seen
a woman afraid of him in his life. In his narrow experience,
they had always seemed glad that he should be
near them, and should speak to them. Therefore, when
he saw that Zoë was terrified, he did not know what to
do or say, and he stupidly repeated his question,</p>

<p>'Are you afraid of me?'</p>

<p>Zoë dug her little nails into the palms of her hands,
and looked round the room, as if for help; but the two
maids had disappeared as soon as the master had entered,
for so they had been taught to do by their trainer.
She was quite alone with the man who had paid for her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>All sorts of confused thoughts crowded her brain, as
Zeno sat down on a seat beside the divan. She wondered
what would happen if she told him her story in
a few words, and appealed to his generosity. She guessed
that he was kind; at least, sometimes. But perhaps
he was a friend of the new Emperor, and it would amuse
him to know that he had bought Michael Rhangabé's
daughter. Or he might send for Rustan, and insist
on revoking the bargain, and Rustan might take her
back to the beggars' quarter, and force poor Kyría Agatha
to give up the money. Zoë knew at once little and much
of the world of Constantinople, but of one thing she
was certain, there would be neither mercy nor kindness
for any of her name while Andronicus reigned in Blachernæ.</p>

<p>She was terrified by the presence of her master, but
she was perfectly brave in her resolve; the sight of death
itself before her eyes should not make her do anything
whereby those for whom she had sold herself might
suffer.</p>

<p>Zeno sat still and looked at her. It seemed to him that
she was far more beautiful than he had at first realised.
As she leaned sideways against the big cushions, turning
her face away and her shoulder towards him, there was
something in the line of her cheek and of her neck where
it joined the ear, and in the little downy ringlets at the
roots of her hair that stirred his blood, against his will.
Also, the devil came and whispered to his heart that she
was his personal property, as much as his horse, his
house and his stores of merchandise. The laws about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
slaves were uncertain enough in Italy, but there was no
doubt of the law in Constantinople. The slave Arethusa,
weighing so many talents and minæ, having so
many sound teeth, and other good points, was the absolute
property of Carlo Zeno. He might kill her, if he
liked, in any way he chose, and the law would not call
it murder. There would be one slave less, and he would
have thrown away four hundred gold ducats; but that
would be all.</p>

<p>She seemed to him the most beautiful creature in the
world, and the devil was not suggesting that he should
kill her; not by any means.</p>

<p>For a long time, the man and his slave were silent, and
scarcely moved, and neither of them afterwards forgot
those minutes. In their thoughts each was struggling
with what seemed an impossibility, a something which
could never be done. The high-born girl, for the sake
of a mother who was not her mother, and of brothers
who were not of her blood, was resolved to be to the end
what she had made herself to save their lives, the obedient
slave of a merchant who had paid gold for her.
It was worse than death, but if she did not die of it,
she must live through it, lest the good she had done
should be undone again.</p>

<p>The man who had the law's own right of life and death
over her, and whose warm young blood her beauty stirred
so profoundly, chose to resist and play that he was not
the master after all. His lean face was calm enough
in the quiet lamplight, as it would have been in raging
battle; but within was that he would not care to feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
again, nor perhaps to let others know that he had
felt.</p>

<p>At last, wondering at the stillness, half-believing and
quite hoping that he was no longer in the room, Zoë
turned her head. His eyes were on her, but there was
something in them that she could not fear.</p>

<p>'Tell me who you are,' he said quietly.</p>

<p>Of all questions she had least expected this one,
which seemed so natural to him. She waited a moment
before she spoke.</p>

<p>'Are you dissatisfied, sir?' she asked in a low voice.
'Has the Bokharian cheated you?'</p>

<p>'No! What a thought!'</p>

<p>'Then you know what I am, and I can tell you nothing
more, my lord. Can a slave have a pedigree?'</p>

<p>'I do not believe that you were born a slave,' said Zeno,
leaning forward a little and looking into her eyes.</p>

<p>After a moment, her lids drooped under his gaze, but
she would not speak.</p>

<p>'Have you nothing to say?' he asked, disappointed
at her silence.</p>

<p>Again the temptation seized her to tell him all, since
he spoke so kindly; but still she thought of what might
happen to Kyría Agatha.</p>

<p>'I am your bought slave,' she said, almost directly.
'I have nothing else to tell.'</p>

<p>'But you had a mother?'</p>

<p>'I never knew her.'</p>

<p>'Your father, then?'</p>

<p>'I never knew him.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>Zeno was not always patient, even with women, and
there was no reason why he should be forbearing with
his own property.</p>

<p>'I do not believe you,' he said in a tone of annoyance,
and he rose and began to pace the room.</p>

<p>Now it chanced that Zoë had been able to answer
his last two questions quite truthfully, for she had not
the least recollection of her own father and mother,
who had died of the plague when she was three months
old.</p>

<p>'I will swear to you on all holy things that it is true,'
she said, watching him.</p>

<p>He made an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>'A slave cannot take an oath,' he answered roughly.</p>

<p>Zoë lifted her beautiful head at once, and her eyes
shone; but he did not see, for he had turned his back
on her in his walk, and a moment later she resumed her
former submissive attitude.</p>

<p>Zeno stopped near the door and clapped his hands;
the two maids appeared.</p>

<p>'Bring supper,' he said.</p>

<p>As they went to obey he came back and sat down
again beside the divan. There was just room to place
a small table between him and Zoë. The girls came
back and waited on them, but neither spoke. Zeno prepared
a salad himself with ingredients brought ready for
making it, and when it was dressed he helped Zoë to a
little of it. She had watched him, for the Italian custom
was new to her and she had never known how a salad
was composed. Zeno poured Greek wine into her glass,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
a delicate white goblet from Murano, with faint blue
lines round the stem. But she neither ate nor drank.</p>

<p>'Go,' said Zeno to the maids. 'I will call you.'</p>

<p>The two slipped away noiselessly. Zeno had forgotten
his displeasure, and he felt her presence again.</p>

<p>'You must eat and drink,' he said gently. 'If there
is anything you like, tell me. You shall have it.'</p>

<p>'You are kind,' she answered, but she did not lift her
hand. 'I have no appetite,' she added, after a little
pause.</p>

<p>I do not know why no man believes a woman when
she says that she is not hungry. Zeno was annoyed, and
by way of showing his displeasure he himself began to eat
more than he wanted. Zoë looked on in silence while
he finished another bird and all the salad he had made.
She would not have been a woman if she had not seen
that he felt a little shy, all at once, as the most fearless
and energetic men may before a woman they do not
understand. Then there was a change for the better
in her own state; she breathed more freely, her heart
beat more steadily, the weight that lay like lead on her
chest, just below her throat, was lightened. When a
woman sees that a man is shy with her, she is sure that
sooner or later he will turn at her will; and though she
is sometimes mistaken, the chances are that she is right.</p>

<p>Zeno had never been shy before; but now, when he
wished to speak, he could find nothing to say, and Zoë
knew it, and would not help him. It was strange that
as her fear subsided she thought him handsomer than at
first sight, in the morning. When he had finished eating,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
he drank some wine, set down the glass, and looked at
her with an expression that was meant to show something
like anger; for he already regretted the time&mdash;distant
five minutes&mdash;when she had been afraid of
him, and he had been master of the situation. He drew
his brows together, set his lips, and glared at her, but to
his amazement she did not seem frightened. He had
lost the thread, for the time, and she had found it. She
answered his look with one of gentle surprise.</p>

<p>'Have you finished supper already?' she asked
sweetly.</p>

<p>A slight flush rose in his brown cheek, as he felt his
shyness increase, but he kept his eyes steadily on her.</p>

<p>'You do not seem to be afraid of me any longer,' he
said, by way of answer.</p>

<p>'Have I anything to fear from you?' she asked, in
a trusting tone.</p>

<p>She risked everything on the question, or thought she
did. She won. His face changed and softened, for by
appealing to his generosity she had put him at ease.</p>

<p>'No,' he answered. 'You never were in danger from
me. Besides,' he added, with something like an effort,
'I have not made up my mind what to do with you.'</p>

<p>Zoë sat up straight, resting one hand on the edge of
the little table.</p>

<p>'The truth is,' he went on, 'I did not buy you for
myself.'</p>

<p>Zoë made a quick movement in her seat. Then her
tender mouth hardened in a look of contempt.</p>

<p>'So you are only another slave-dealer!' she cried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
scornfully. But Zeno laughed at the mere idea, and was
glad to laugh. It was a relief.</p>

<p>'No,' he said, 'I am not a slave-dealer. I am a Venetian
merchant, I believe. I have been a soldier, and I
came near being a prebendary!'</p>

<p>'A priest!' Zoë's face showed her disgust.</p>

<p>'No, for I never was in orders,' answered Zeno, growing
more sure of himself as she grew more angry. 'But
as for you, a friend of mine, a rich gentleman of Venice,
has asked me as a favour to send him the most beautiful
slave to be had in Constantinople for the large price he
named. As a matter of fact&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But here he was interrupted, for Zoë turned from him
and buried her face in the leathern cushion. Her body
shook a little, and Zeno thought she was crying. She
had grown almost used to him, and had begun to feel
that she might have some power over him; and she was
ashamed to own that he attracted her, though she meant
to hate him. But the idea that he had only bought her
like a piece of goods, to pass her on to an unknown man
far away, was more than she could bear at first. Moreover,
though the idea of eating sickened her, she was
really weakened by need of food, and she had undergone
within twenty-four hours as much as her nature
could bear without breaking down in some way.</p>

<p>Zeno was distressed, and bent over her, rather awkwardly,
anxious to soothe her. She turned her face to
him suddenly, without warning, and he saw that her
eyes were dry and her cheeks flushed.</p>

<p>'Venice is a beautiful city,' he said coaxingly. 'You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
will be a great person in my friend's house&mdash;he will
give you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'When are you going to send me? To-morrow?'
The girl had mastered herself a little.</p>

<p>'I have told you that I have not made up my mind
about you,' Zeno answered. 'The money I gave the
Bokharian was my own. I may keep you here after all.'</p>

<p>Zoë detested him in that moment. She longed to insult
him, to strike him, to drive him away. There was
something so condescending in what he said. He would
make up his mind about her! He might keep her after
all! He had paid his own money for her! It was not
possible that she could have thought him handsome,
that she could have been even momentarily attracted
by his face, his manner, or his voice.</p>

<p>'I hate you!' she cried, shutting her teeth tightly
as she spoke.</p>

<p>He was near her, and she drew back from him as far
as she could against the cushions of the divan. He
resumed his seat, for he saw how angry she was. He
had purposely spoken as if she were really the slave she
told him that she was, and against the natural instinct
which bade him treat her as his equal.</p>

<p>'Indeed,' he said coldly, and he took a cracked walnut
from the table and began to peel the kernel, 'it is not
easy to know what will please you. You seem horrified
at the idea of going to Venice and furious at the thought
of staying here! Of course, there is a third possibility.
I would not send my friend a slave who would be so
discontented as to poison him and his family, and I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
certainly not keep one in my house who hates me and
may take it into her head to cut my throat in my sleep.
The only thing that remains will be to sell you back to
the Bokharian at a loss. Should you like that?'</p>

<p>Zoë felt again that he was her master.</p>

<p>'You made me think you would be kind to me!' she
said, and her voice quavered.</p>

<p>Zeno laughed, for he had been too much annoyed
to yield at once to her appeal.</p>

<p>'That did not prevent you from saying that you hated
me, a while ago,' he answered. 'You must not expect
too much Christian virtue of me, for I am no saint. I
never learned to love those that hate me!'</p>

<p>She liked him better now; as he threw back his head
a little, looking at her from under his half-closed lids,
she glanced at his brown throat and she did not think
of cutting it, as he had suggested. But she was angry
with herself for passing through so many phases of like
and dislike in so short a time, and for not feeling relief
at the thought of being sent on a long journey, which
certainly would mean safety while it lasted, and perhaps
a chance of freedom. She wondered, too, why she no
longer wished to die outright now that she had saved
Kyría Agatha. Her answer to his last speech was humble.</p>

<p>'You made me say it,' she said. 'I am sorry, sir.'</p>

<p>'At least, I have learnt that you would rather stay
here than go back to Rustan Karaboghazji and that
gentle wife of his&mdash;his red-haired dove!'</p>

<p>'Anything rather than that!'</p>

<p>Her tone was earnest, for it was the fate she feared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
most, both for herself and because she fancied that the
dealer would in some way claim his money from Kyría
Agatha. Zeno was apparently satisfied with her answer,
for he looked more kindly at her and was silent for a
time. Again he allowed his eyes to be delighted with
her beauty.</p>

<p>'I will not send you back,' he said at last; and he held
out his hand towards her, as if he were giving a promise
to an equal.</p>

<p>She was grateful, but she thought that perhaps he
was trying to make her betray her birth. No slave
would take the master's hand familiarly in her own; she
knew the ways of slaves, for there had been many in her
adopted father's house, and she touched the tips of
Zeno's fingers with her own and pressed her lips to the
back of her own hand when she withdrew it. The action
disconcerted him a little, for it was performed perfectly,
with all the deference of born servitude.</p>

<p>'You were not long in Rustan's house, were you?'
he asked, not seeming to be much interested in the answer,
for he hoped to take her unawares.</p>

<p>If she told the truth, which he knew, he would show
surprise and press her with another question; if she
answered with an untruth he should gain that much
knowledge of her character for future use. Quick-witted,
she did neither.</p>

<p>'It pleased my lord to remind me a while ago that a
slave's oath is never to be believed,' she said. 'It is
the law that a slave must be tortured when giving evidence,
is it not?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>'I believe it is,' answered Zeno, with a smile. 'But
you are quite safe! I only ask you how long you were
in Rustan's house.'</p>

<p>'One night and part of a day,' Zoë answered after a
moment.</p>

<p>Zeno pretended surprise.</p>

<p>'So short a time! Then he only bought you yesterday?'</p>

<p>'Yesterday evening.'</p>

<p>'And of whom? Will you tell me that?'</p>

<p>Zoë reflected a moment and then smiled.</p>

<p>'Yes. I will tell you that. He bought me of a lady
of Constantinople, in whose closest intimacy I was brought
up. She is just of my own age and we are much
alike.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Zeno, completely deceived, and speaking
almost to himself. 'Poor girl! The same father, I
suppose&mdash;hence the&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Zoë drooped her eyes and looked at the carpet.</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;since you have guessed it, sir. We had the
same father, though we never knew him. He died of
the plague when we were a few months old.'</p>

<p>Zeno was perfectly satisfied with this logical explanation
which entirely explained Zoë's aristocratic beauty,
her nobility of manner, and the delicate rearing that was
so apparent in all her ways, as well as the fearlessness
which had made her turn upon him and tell him that she
hated him. The only point he could not understand,
was that Zoë should have smiled. But he thought, as
was quite possible, that there might have been jealousy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
and even hatred between the mistress and her slave-born
sister, and he would not enquire too closely yet,
since all was so clear to him. Such unnatural doings
were not rare in a city half-filled with slaves. Zoë's
mistress had probably sold her in a fit of anger, or perhaps
deliberately and with a cruel purpose, or even out
of avarice, to buy a string of pearls.</p>

<p>The girl did not offer to say more, but she looked
away from her owner and seemed to be thinking of the
past, as indeed she was, though it was so different from
that which his imagination was inventing for her.</p>

<p>He, on his side, peeled another walnut thoughtfully,
and looked at her from time to time, sure that he knew
the truth, and wondering what he ought to do, and above
all what he really wished to do. He had believed her
deeply wronged, and had paid a great sum to redress that
wrong, almost without hesitating, because it was his
nature to help any one in distress, and because he, who
counted neither life nor limb when his cause was good,
had never counted such stuff as gold in a like case.</p>

<p>But now, it was all clear. She was a slave, in spite of
all appearances. She had suffered no injustice; her
smile had told him that the change in her life had not
been to greater unhappiness. That she should fear to
be sent back to Rustan was only natural; she, who had
no doubt always lived delicately in the great house
where she had been born, must have felt the sordidness
and the degradation of the slave-prison, in spite of the
special care she had received in consideration of her
beauty and value. Very likely, too, she had not much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
real feeling, in spite of her behaviour; slave women
rarely have.</p>

<p>What should he do with her? He was passionate
rather than material or pleasure-loving; he was consequently
an optimist and an idealist where women were
concerned, and was full of a vague belief in the romantic
side of love. He could no more really love a slave-girl
than he could have loved a hired maid, though she
might be beautiful beyond comparison, for he was incapable
of attaching himself to beauty alone. Only
his equal could be his mate, and he never could care long
or truly for any creature that was less. At twenty,
the youth in him would have boiled up and over for a
week, or a month; but he was verging on thirty, his
thirty years that had been crammed with the deeds of
many a daring man's whole life-time, and his nature had
hardened in a nobler mould than his early youth had
promised. He would not make a plaything of any
woman now; and since he would not, he wondered what
he should do with Zoë, now that she was his.</p>

<p>In this mood of uncertainty he rose to leave her, more
or less resolved not to see her again until he had come
to some conclusion as to her future; for in spite of all
he still felt himself attracted to her, and the line of her
cheek and throat when her face was half-turned away
was of exquisite beauty. Standing beside her for a
moment, he knew that if ever again in his life he stooped
to take a woman for a toy, lovelessly, stupidly, contemptibly,
the plaything would be this Arethusa whom he
had bought of a scoundrelly Bokharian dealer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>'Good-night,' he said, looking down into her upturned
eyes. 'If you need anything, if you want anything,
send for Omobono, and you shall have it. Good-night,
Arethusa.'</p>

<p>It was the first time he had called her by her name,
as he knew it. He did not even hold out his hand.
She looked up steadily.</p>

<p>'What shall you do with me?' she asked, very anxiously,
surprised by his sudden leave-taking.</p>

<p>She was so lovely then that he felt a despicable impulse
to take her into his arms, just for her loveliness,
and close her sad eyes with kisses. Instead, he shook
his head and turned away.</p>

<p>'I do not know,' he said, half-aloud. He reached
the door. 'I do not know,' he repeated, as if the problem
were very hard to solve; and he went out, not turning
back to look at her.</p>

<p>Thus ended the first hour the slave spent with her
master; and when he was gone she felt suddenly exhausted,
as if she had fought with her hands; and
strangely enough she knew all at once that she was weak
from want of food, and that the thought of eating no
longer disgusted her. Half-ashamed of herself, she
glanced at the door through which Zeno had disappeared,
as if she thought he might come back, and listened, as
though expecting his footstep. Then, not seeing or
hearing anything, she began to eat quickly, and almost
ravenously, as if she were doing something to be a little
ashamed of, and she hoped that the maids would not
come in and see her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>She was soon satisfied, for it had been a nervous
craving rather than anything else, and every woman
who reads these lines knows precisely how Zoë felt, or
will know one of these days; for in all that belongs to the
instinctive side of life, women are much more alike than
men are; whereas, because they are not led, pushed,
or dragged through one average course of teaching, as
most men are, but are left to think and above all, to
guess at truth for themselves, they are much more unlike
in their way of looking at things. This also is the reason
why many gifted men and a good many really learned
ones would rather talk to women than to men; for among
men they hear the same things everlastingly, but women
always have something new to say, which is flattering,
pleasant, amusing, or irritating&mdash;perhaps, as they
choose. Women have also a sort of mock-humble,
wholly appealing way of asking the great man how it
is possible that he can really care to talk with a poor,
ignorant, little woman, when he might be engaged in a
memorable conversation with the other great man, who
is talking to the other poor, ignorant little woman with
lovely eyes, on the other side of the room. In this way
we learn that life is full of contradictions.</p>

<p>Zoë slept ten hours without dreaming, and awoke
refreshed and rested, to wonder presently why her mood
had changed so much. But Zeno was restless in the
night, and dissatisfied with himself and with what he
had done; when he lay awake he found fault with his
impulsive action, but when he fell asleep for half-an-hour
Zoë haunted his dreams. More than once he got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
up and walked barefoot on the marble mosaic pavement
of his room, and he threw open the shutters and looked
out. The night was calm and clear, and the air was almost
wintry. To the left of Pera's towering outline the
northern constellations shone bright and cold. Each
time he looked he wondered at the slow motion of the
Bear; the seven stars hung above the Pole, for it was
springtime, and they hardly seemed to have moved a
handbreadth to their westward sinking in a whole hour,
when he looked again. When morning came his face
was a little paler than usual, and he felt that he was in
a bad humour.</p>

<p>Omobono only guessed it from a certain increase of
his natural reserve, but that was enough for the experienced
secretary, who was wonderfully careful not
to speak unless Zeno spoke to him, and, above all, not
to mention the existence of the women's apartment
upstairs. On the other hand, although it was a Sunday,
he had expected to be sent by his master to draw the
money from the house of Cornèr, according to Pesaro's
letter, of which he had thoroughly mastered the contents.
But the order was not given, and as Zeno was neither
forgetful of details nor slack in matters of business,
Omobono began to wonder what had happened.</p>

<p>On Monday Zeno's mood had not changed, nor did
he send for the money, and the secretary's curiosity grew
mightily; on Tuesday it became almost unbearable.
So far as he knew, and he knew most things that went
on in the house, Zeno had only once gone upstairs, when
he had supped with Zoë on Saturday evening, and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
remained barely an hour. Since then he had not even
asked after the slave, and no one had seen her except
the two little maids, who came out upon the landing
to receive the meals at regular hours, but never spoke to
the men-servants. The secretary could have asked to
see Zoë, to enquire if she needed anything, and she
would certainly have received him; but he was afraid
to do so without orders, and Zeno gave none, and might
come in at the very moment when Omobono was there.
The industrious secretary had fits of abstraction over
his letters and accounts, and stared out of the window,
stroking his neatly-trimmed grey beard very thoughtfully.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a little before noon, Zoë was sitting
in her window, and she again saw Zeno go down the
steps to the water and get into his skiff. It was always
there now, even at dawn, for since there had been women
in the house Zeno had been rowed to another place for
his morning plunge in the Golden Horn. To-day he
was dressed with particular care, Zoë thought, as she
caught sight of him, and she did not draw back from
the window, as she had done the first time, but stayed
where she was, and she wished in her heart that he would
look up and see her. He did not even turn as he stepped
into the boat, and she thought he held his head lower
than when she had last seen him, and looked down,
and raised his shoulders a little like a person determined
not to look to the right or the left. Then the two men
pulled the skiff away upstream, and she watched it till
she could no longer distinguish it from many others that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
moved about on the water in the direction of the palace.
She wondered where he went.</p>

<p>He had not been gone ten minutes when a man came
to the gate of the fore-court on the other side of the house,
and asked to see the secretary. He was simply dressed
in a clean brown woollen tunic, that hung almost to
the ground. It had wide sleeves, and they hid his joined
hands as he stood waiting, in the attitude monks often
take before a superior, or when reciting prayers before
meals. But the man was not a monk, for he wore a
broad belt of dark red leather, in which he carried a
sheathed knife, a Syrian ink-horn, and a small cylindrical
case of hammered brass, which held his reed pens.
On his head he wore a tall felt cap, such as dervishes
now wear.</p>

<p>The slave at the door looked at him attentively before
admitting him. There was something unusual in his
expression, though his features were not very marked,
and he had the rather pasty complexion that is so common
in the East. His eyes were perhaps a little longer
and more almond-shaped than those of the average
Greek or Bokharian, and he kept them half-closed. His
scanty black beard had a few grey hairs in it. His
nostrils curved sharply, but the nose was neither very
large nor markedly aquiline. A commonplace face
enough in Constantinople; but there was something
oddly fixed in its expression, that made the slave feel
uncomfortable and yet submissive. Many persons of
all conditions came to the merchant's house on business
during the day, and it was the rule to send them to Omobono.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
The slave's business was to keep out thieves,
beggars, and suspicious characters; he stood aside, admitted
the visitor to the court which separated the house
from the street, and shut the gate again.</p>

<p>One of the free house-servants, of whom two or three
were always waiting, came forward&mdash;a square-shouldered
Venetian named Vito, who had been a sailor and
had followed Zeno for years. He enquired the stranger's
name and business.</p>

<p>'I am Gorlias Pietrogliant,' was the answer. 'My
business with the secretary is private.'</p>

<p>The serving-man disappeared, and returned a moment
later to conduct the visitor to the private room of the
counting-house on the ground floor, where Omobono
sat behind a high desk covered with papers and slips of
parchment.</p>

<p>Omobono straightened himself on his stool and eyed
the newcomer with a look of enquiry, at the same time
drawing from his right arm the half sleeve of grey cotton
which he always put on when he was going to write long,
lest a spot of ink should stain the soft linen wrist-band
which just showed below the tight cuff of his coat. He
was a careful man. He looked at his visitor keenly,
till he suddenly became aware that his scrutiny was returned
with a rather disquieting fixedness.</p>

<p>'I am Gorlias Pietrogliant,' said the stranger.</p>

<p>Omobono bent his head politely, and wondered whether
he should be able to repeat such an outlandish name.</p>

<p>'I am Messer Zeno's secretary,' he answered. 'What
is your business, Master Porlias Dietroplant?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>'Gorlias,' corrected the other, quite unmoved. Gorlias
Pietrogliant.'</p>

<p>'Master Gorlias&mdash;I beg your pardon.'</p>

<p>'I am an astrologer,' observed the visitor, seating
himself on a high stool at Omobono's elbow, and relapsing
into silence.</p>

<p>'You are an astrologer,' said the secretary tentatively,
after a long pause, for he did not know what to
say.</p>

<p>'Yes, I told you so,' replied Gorlias; and for a few
seconds longer it did not seem to occur to him that there
was anything else to be said.</p>

<p>There was something so oddly fixed in his look and so
dull in his voice that Omobono began to fear that he
might be a lunatic, which was indeed, in the secretary's
opinion, much the same as an astrologer, for the Venetians
were never great believers in the influence of the stars.
But the visitor soon made him forget his suspicions by
reviving his curiosity.</p>

<p>'The matter which brings me to you is of a very delicate
nature,' said Gorlias, all at once speaking fluently
and in a low voice. 'I have reason to believe that we
are interested in the same business.'</p>

<p>'Are we?' asked the secretary in some surprise.</p>

<p>'I think we are. I think we are, by four toes and by
five toes!'</p>

<p>'Over the water,' answered Omobono promptly, and
hoping to learn more.</p>

<p>'Both salt and fresh,' returned Gorlias. 'By these
tokens I shall trust to your fidelity and discretion.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_151" id="i_151"></a>
<img src="images/i_151.jpg" width="410" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">There was something so oddly fixed in his look and so dull in his voice that
Omobono began to fear that he might be a lunatic.</p>
</div>

<p>'Implicitly,' replied the Venetian, who was sure of
being discreet, but wondered what the matter might be
to which his fidelity was pledged beforehand. He
inwardly hoped that his visitor was not going to ask him
for money, for he suspected that some awful fate must
be in store for those who refused a service when appealed
to by the mysterious passwords, of which he had now
learnt one more.</p>

<p>'Messer Carlo is gone out,' said Gorlias. 'By this time
he is in the house of Messer Sebastian Polo, who wishes
to marry him to his daughter. He will not come home
till after dinner.'</p>

<p>Omobono stared at the speaker.</p>

<p>'You know more than I do,' he observed.</p>

<p>'Of course. I am an astrologer. You are in charge
of the house and all it contains, and the servants and
slaves are afraid of you because you have the master's
ear, but they love you because you are kind to them.
Therefore, whatever you do is right in their eyes. Upstairs
there are three female slaves; one is Arethusa,
the other two are called Yulia and Lucilla, and wait on
her. You see, I know everything. Now, for the sake
of that business in which we are both interested, you
must take me up to their apartment, for I must speak
with the one called Arethusa.'</p>

<p>Omobono wished that Gorlias had asked him for his
coat, or his money, or anything that was his, rather than
for such a favour; and he was about to risk refusing
it, whatever the penalty might be, when a luminous idea
revealed itself to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>'There is only one condition,' he answered, after a
moment's thought. 'I must be present while you talk
with her.'</p>

<p>'That need not disturb you,' said Gorlias calmly.
'I have seen the room where she is by virtue of my
knowledge of the stars. It has a small covered balcony
with an outer lattice against the sun, on the south side.
There I will talk with Arethusa, while you stand by the
door and watch us. I will draw figures, and appear to
explain them to her, so that the two girl-slaves may
think that I have come to amuse her by setting up her
horoscope. Even Messer Carlo could not object to that,
and Arethusa can veil herself, so that I shall not be able
to see her face.'</p>

<p>Omobono reflected a moment, but could now see no
good reason for refusing the request, whereas he saw
a prospect of learning something more about the mystery
that interested him. Zoë herself had prompted him
with the second password of the chain, in Rustan's
house, and he was almost sure that in some way she
knew the rest, and the meaning of them all.</p>

<p>The two went up the marble stairs to the second story,
and Omobono tapped at the entrance to the women's
apartment. There came a little pattering of slippered
feet, and Lucilla opened the door just enough to put
her head out, for it was not yet time for the mid-day
meal, and she wondered what was wanted.</p>

<p>'Bid your mistress veil herself, my child,' said Omobono.
'Here is a famous astrologer come to tell her the
future, which will help her to pass the time.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>Lucilla glanced at Gorlias with curiosity and smiled,
showing all her teeth.</p>

<p>'Indeed it is very dull here,' she observed, and disappeared,
shutting the door behind her.</p>

<p>While the two men waited Gorlias produced from the
folds of his wide tunic a big roll of parchment, which he
unrolled a foot or two, displaying a multitude of incomprehensible
signs and figures; he also took out a large
brass compass, a sheet of cotton paper from Padua, also
rolled up, and an Arabic almanack with a silver clasp.
Omobono surveyed these preparations with mingled
curiosity and sceptical amusement, till Lucilla opened
the door again and ushered both men into Zoë's presence.
The astrologer made cabalistic signs with his right hand
while he advanced, as if he were drawing imaginary figures
in the air with his extended forefinger. Zoë's face was
quite concealed in the double folds of a white gauze veil,
but she seemed to watch him attentively as he came
towards her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p>Zoë and the astrologer sat in the covered balcony in
full view of the secretary, who remained near the door,
straining his sharp ears in vain to catch some words
of the whispered conversation. The maids had been
dismissed. From time to time Gorlias spoke aloud,
pointing with his compass to different parts of the figure,
but what he said only made it more impossible to guess
at what he whispered. Zoë sat almost motionless, but
she had opened the folds of her veil so as to uncover
her mouth, and after her companion had been speaking
some time she bent down and answered in his ear, pretending,
however, to point to the figures on the paper,
as if she were asking questions.</p>

<p>The substance of what Gorlias told her was that he
and his friends were interested in a mighty enterprise,
and had often tried to sound Carlo Zeno with regard to
helping them to carry it out, but they had met with no
success, for he either did not understand, or he would not.
Messer Sebastian Polo, whose house he frequented, was
a timid man, and was not to be trusted with such a
secret; moreover, he was so extremely anxious to make
Zeno marry his daughter, that he would certainly never
allow him to run any risks.</p>

<p>All this he put very clearly, and Omobono might have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
been surprised to learn that he had not used any password.
Then Zoë bent down to his ear.</p>

<p>'What is the name of Sebastian Polo's daughter?'
she asked.</p>

<p>'Giustina,' whispered the astrologer. 'The sun near
to mid-heaven,' he continued aloud, 'and in trine aspect
to Mars, signifies fine horses and a retinue of servants.'
He dropped his voice again. 'She is thirty, and has had
the smallpox,' he whispered.</p>

<p>'The master has only been here once since I came,'
said Zoë, bending to his ear again. 'I have no influence
with him.'</p>

<p>Gorlias turned his face towards her in slow surprise.</p>

<p>'Had he not seen you before he bought you, Kokóna
Arethusa?' he enquired.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed!'</p>

<p>'Oh! I thought that you also might have had the smallpox,'
was the whispered answer.</p>

<p>Zoë could not help laughing a little. The pretty notes,
muffled by the veil, seemed to come from far away. It
was the first time she had laughed naturally since many
weeks. The astrologer bent nearer to her when she was
silent again, and spoke aloud, pointing to his figure.</p>

<p>'Venus is in the Seventh House in benign aspect to the
Moon,' he said aloud. 'You will be fortunate in love.'
Then he whispered again, 'I will give you a philtre that
has never failed. The next time he comes&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Zoë shook her head decidedly, with something that
looked like indignation.</p>

<p>'It is for a good matter, Kokóna,' Gorlias answered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
'If you will help us, you shall have pearls and diamonds,
and gold and liberty.'</p>

<p>'Liberty? How?'</p>

<p>Gorlias thought that he had tempted her with that,
at least.</p>

<p>'If you will promise your help with Messer Carlo, I
will tell you.'</p>

<p>'How can I promise what is not mine to give?' asked
the girl.</p>

<p>The astrologer was not discouraged, and after more
talk about the planets, in a tone loud enough to be heard
by the maids if they were listening at the door, he went
on quickly again.</p>

<p>'Messer Carlo is a man who loves adventures, who has
led desperate and forlorn hope to victory, both in Italy
and Greece, who has the gift of the leader, if ever a man
had it. Surely, you knew all this.'</p>

<p>'I know he has been a soldier,' Zoë answered, for Zeno
had told her so.</p>

<p>'He also possesses some fortune, and has great connexions
in Venice. Moreover, I can tell you, Kokóna,
that this is no small matter. If he succeeds, he will
earn gratitude of the Serene Republic and honour everywhere.'</p>

<p>'As much as that?' asked Zoë, looking attentively
at the astrologer through her veil. 'How am I to believe
you?'</p>

<p>'I thought I had spoken clearly enough,' Gorlias answered,
'but lest you should doubt my word and promise,
take these.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span></p>

<p>He had furtively slipped his hand into the bosom of
his tunic, and when he withdrew it his fingers closed over
something he held gathered in his palm. Cleverly
turning the sheet of paper on which he had shown his
astrological figures, so as to hinder Omobono from seeing,
he disclosed to Zoë a short string of very large and beautiful
pearls.</p>

<p>'In your nativity,' he rattled on, aloud, 'the beneficent
influences altogether outweigh the malefic ones.'</p>

<p>He said much more to the same effect, and while he
was speaking he let the pearls slip down upon the skirts
of Zoë's over-garment on the side away from the secretary.</p>

<p>'They are yours,' he whispered. 'You shall have a
hundred strings like them if you succeed.'</p>

<p>'Give such things to my maids,' Zoë answered, 'not
to me! If you are in earnest make a sign, that I may know
whence you come.'</p>

<p>'A sign?' repeated Gorlias, as if not understanding.</p>

<p>'Yes, where?' Her mouth was close to his ear as
she whispered the question, and she turned her ear towards
him for the answer.</p>

<p>He hesitated, and for the first time the dull fixedness
of his expression was momentarily dispelled by a very
faint look of surprise.</p>

<p>'I ask, where?' Zoë repeated, with strong emphasis,
bending to him again.</p>

<p>'Over the water,' he answered at last.</p>

<p>'Both salt and fresh,' she replied instantly.</p>

<p>Gorlias looked at her veiled face long.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span></p>

<p>'Who are you?' he asked at length. 'Who taught
you these things?' He glanced suspiciously at Omobono,
who, as he had reason to believe, was acquainted
with the secret.</p>

<p>Zoë shook her head.</p>

<p>'No,' she answered. 'One greater than he taught
me what I know. You may go now, for your message
is delivered. What I can do, I will do, and there is no
more to say, for it is my own cause as well as his&mdash;the
cause of justice, and God is with it.'</p>

<p>Gorlias spoke aloud again, and brought his explanation
of the horoscope to a conclusion by informing Zoë
that if she wished to know the smaller details of her
wonderful future, she must consult him at intervals,
as the phases of the moon had a great influence on her
fate.</p>

<p>'When the Kokóna wishes to see me,' he said, rising,
'Messer Omobono will send for me, and I will come.'</p>

<p>Before Zoë realised that he had not picked up the string
of pearls, he had made his obeisance and was at the door
with Omobono, who bowed low to her, and ushered him
out.</p>

<p>When she was alone she took the necklace from the
folds of her dress, where it had lain, and looked at it a
moment before she hid it in her bosom. For she would
not allow the maids to see it, and was already debating
how she should hide it till she could find an opportunity
of giving it back. But when the cold pearls touched her
flesh they sent a little chill to her heart, and she thought
it was somehow like a warning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>She understood well enough what had happened, for
she was quick-witted. Rustan, who had shown that he
knew the secret, and his wife, who had spoken to him of
Gorlias, had told the latter that Carlo Zeno was in love
with a beautiful Greek slave, who could, of course, be
easily induced by gifts to use her influence with her
master. For Zeno's past deeds had already woven a sort
of legend about his name, so that even the soldiers talked
of him among themselves, and told stories of the desperate
bravery and amazing skill with which he had
kept a small Turkish army at bay in Greece with a handful
of men for nearly a whole year, and many other
tales, of which the most fantastic was less strange than
much that afterwards happened to him in his life.</p>

<p>It must have seemed easy enough to the astrologer,
and even to Omobono perhaps; but it looked strangely
impossible to Zoë herself, when she remembered her only
interview with the man whom she was now pledged to
win over.</p>

<p>The whole situation was known to her. A conspiracy
was on foot to take the Emperor Johannes from his
prison and restore him to the throne, imprisoning his
son Andronicus in the Amena tower in his stead. Thousands
of John's loyal subjects recognised each other by
passwords, and talked secretly of a great rising, in which
some foresaw vengeance for the wrongs they had suffered,
while others, like the Bokharian Rustan, hoped for fortune,
reward, and perhaps honour. But the body of
the army was not with them yet, the disaffected men
lacked skill or courage to preach the cause of the lawful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Emperor to their comrades, and the revolution had no
guiding spirit. It is far easier to choose a general among
soldiers than to pick out a leader of revolt amongst
untried and untrained men.</p>

<p>Before he lost his liberty the Emperor had known
Zeno, and though a weak man, had judged him rightly.
In his prison he possessed means of communicating
occasionally with his friends, and he had instructed
them to ask Zeno's help; but so far his message
had either not been delivered or Zeno had been deaf to
the appeal, perhaps judging that the time was not come
for the attempt, or that, after all, the cause was not a
good one. Having failed to move him in all other ways,
the revolutionaries had seized the unexpected opportunity
that now presented itself.</p>

<p>The thought that such a man might turn the tide of
history, restore the rightful sovereign to the throne,
and avenge the awful death of Michael Rhangabé, had
crossed Zoë's mind when she had first seen her purchaser
in Rustan's house, for the born leader and fighting man
generally has something in his face that is not to be mistaken;
but to influence Carlo was another matter, as
she had understood when he had supped with her. It
would be as hard to induce him to do anything he was
not inclined to do of his own accord as it would be impossible
to hinder him from attempting whatever he chose
to try. As for winning him to the cause by gentler
means, the high-born girl blushed at the suggestion.
He was certainly not in love with her at first sight; of
that she was as sure as that she did not love him either.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>Yet while she was thinking, she suddenly wondered
whether Gorlias had spoken the truth about Giustina
Polo. Was she really thirty, and was her face pitted
like a cheese-grater, as Gorlias had told her? If she
was ugly, why did Zeno go to Polo's house so often?
For Zoë had no doubt but that he went there every time
he was rowed up the Golden Horn in his pretty skiff.
He was always carefully dressed when he stepped into
his boat; it was not for old Polo that he wore such fine
clothes.</p>

<p>She was very lonely now. During the first two days
she had rested herself in her luxurious surroundings,
not without the excitement of expecting another visit
from Zeno, and she had thought with satisfaction of
all the comfort her sacrifice must have brought to her
adopted mother, to the little boys, and to poor old Nectaria.
But now she wished she could at least be sure that
all was well with them, though she was rather sadly
conscious that she did not miss them as she had thought
she must. During many months she had nursed Kyría
Agatha most tenderly, and had helped the old slave to
take care of the children; the last weeks had been spent
in abject misery, the last days in the final struggle with
starvation and sickness, and still she had bravely done
her best. Yet she had long felt that Kyría Agatha
had not much real affection for her, and would let her
starve herself to death to feed her and the boys. It
would have been otherwise if Rhangabé had lived;
she would have willingly died of hunger for him, but he
was gone, and though she had done and borne the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
impossible, it had not been for her own blood, but for the
sake of the good and brave man's memory. He was in
peace, after the agony of his death, his wife and his sons
were provided for, so far as Zoë could provide by giving
her freedom and her life for them. As far as she could
she had paid her debt of gratitude to the dead, and the
debt that was not wiped out was due to her; those who
had murdered Rhangabé owed her his unspeakable
sufferings and every precious drop of his heart's blood.
They should pay. If she lived, they should pay all to
the uttermost.</p>

<p>And now, fate had placed within her reach the instrument
of vengeance, the bravest, rashest, wisest, most
desperate of mankind. Her heart had silently and joyfully
drunk in every word that Gorlias had said about the
man who owned her as he owned the carpet under her feet,
the roof over her head, and the clothes that covered her.</p>

<p>He was within her reach, but he was not within her
power. Not yet. Her mood had changed, and for a
while, not knowing what she dreamt of, she wished that
she were indeed one of those Eastern enchantresses of
whom she had often heard, without half understanding,
who roused men to frenzy, or lulled their lovers to sleep
and ruin, as they would; she wished she were that
wicked Antonina, for whom brave, pure-hearted Belisarius
had humbled himself in the dust; she wished she
were Theodora, shamelessly great and fair, an imperial
Vision of Sin, compelling to her heel the church-going,
priest-haunted master of half the known world&mdash;Justinian.
She knew the story of her adopted country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
What had either of those women that she had not,
wherewith to master a man?</p>

<p>Then the tide of shame came back, and she turned her
face away from the empty room, as if it had guessed
her thoughts; and then, to get away from them, she
called her maids, clapping her hands sharply. They
came running in and stood before her.</p>

<p>'Go, Yulia,' she said, 'find the secretary and beg him
to come to me.'</p>

<p>While she waited, she made Lucilla arrange her veil
again so that it hid her face, and this was scarcely done
when Omobono was ushered in by the other girl. He
bowed to Zoë and gravely stroked his pointed beard.</p>

<p>'What is the Kokóna's pleasure?' he asked, after a
pause.</p>

<p>'Do you speak Latin?' Zoë enquired, in that language.</p>

<p>The little man drew himself up proudly, and cleared
his throat.</p>

<p>'In my family we have been notaries for five generations,'
he answered, in language that was comprehensible
but would have filled an average Churchman with
vague uneasiness, and would have made Cicero's ashes
rattle in their urn.</p>

<p>Zoë was satisfied, however, for though her maids
might understand Italian, she was quite sure that Latin
was beyond them. She herself spoke it far more correctly
than Omobono, though with a rather lisping
Greek accent. She could not have helped saying 'vonus'
for 'bonus,' 'eyo' for 'ego,' and 'Thominus' for 'Dominus.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>'Where is Thominus Carolus?' she enquired, so suddenly
that the secretary was almost taken off his guard.</p>

<p>'He is&mdash;he is gone out,' he answered.</p>

<p>'Yes. He is gone to dine with Messer Sebastian Polo.
He goes there two or three times a week.'</p>

<p>Zoë watched the secretary's face with amusement;
his surprise was comical.</p>

<p>'Then the man is really an astrologer,' he said, in a
wondering tone, 'and star-gazing is not all nonsense!'</p>

<p>'Sebastian Polo's daughter is young and beautiful,'
observed Zoë, who apparently did not place implicit
faith in astrology.</p>

<p>Omobono's face and gesture expressed a qualified
assent, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>'Tell me at once,' said Zoë, 'that she is thirty, that her
complexion resembles the dust when it is pitted by
raindrops after a shower&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'That would not be true,' cried the secretary. 'Giustina
Polo is not supremely beautiful, but she is young
and pretty, and as fresh as roses.'</p>

<p>'But she is very poor,' suggested Zoë. 'She has no
dowry.'</p>

<p>'Who says so?' asked Omobono indignantly. 'The
house of Sebastian Polo is as prosperous as any in Constantinople!
He is as rich as any Venetian here except,
perhaps, Marin Cornèr!'</p>

<p>'Then it is true that the master is going to marry his
daughter,' Zoë replied, as if stating a fact that could no
longer be denied.</p>

<p>She was rapidly working the secretary into a state
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
of excitement in which his Latin grammar went to the
winds.</p>

<p>'No, indeed!' he cried. 'It is altogether a lie! Who
has told you such things?'</p>

<p>'She is young, pretty, fresh as roses, and very rich,'
said Zoë, recapitulating. 'Did you not say so?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And the master goes to dine in her father's house
three times a week&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Do you suppose that Polo would invite the master
so often unless he wanted him for his daughter?'</p>

<p>'Perhaps not&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Or that the master would wilfully deceive Polo and
the girl?'</p>

<p>'What are you saying?'</p>

<p>'Simply that Thominus Carolus is going to marry
Thomna Justina.'</p>

<p>'But I tell you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Either you are very simple, or you think I am,' interrupted
Zoë, with crushing logic. 'Which shall it be,
Master Secretary?'</p>

<p>Omobono thought her a terrible young person just
then. He spread out his hands and looked up to the
ceiling in despair, but still protesting.</p>

<p>'And meanwhile,' she continued, 'what is the master going
to do with me? Am I to be locked up here for ever?'</p>

<p>If anything could further disturb Omobono's equanimity
it was this question. His gentle temper was
beginning to be ruffled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>'How can I tell?' he asked. 'He will do what he
thinks best! Ask him yourself!'</p>

<p>After all, she was only a slave, he said in his heart,
and he was the descendant of five generations of notaries.
What right had she to cross-examine him? He was the
more angry with her for asking the question, because his
own curiosity had tormented him for days to find an
answer to it.</p>

<p>'Omobono,' Zoë said, affecting a very grave tone, 'you
know very well what the master means to do. Now I
ask you solemnly, and you are warned that you must
answer me&mdash;by four&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No, no!' cried the secretary, in sudden distress.
'Do not ask me by that!'</p>

<p>'I must, Omobono; and of course you have been told
what you have to expect if you refuse to help a friend
over the water.'</p>

<p>She emphasised the last words in a way that made
him tremble.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes&mdash;I know&mdash;&mdash;' he said feebly, though he
had not the least notion of the penalty.</p>

<p>'You will be broken to pieces by inches with a small
hammer, beginning at the tips of your fingers till there
is not a whole bone in your body. That is only the beginning.'</p>

<p>Omobono's knees knocked together.</p>

<p>'Then your skin will be turned inside out over your
head and your living heart will be cut out of your body,
Omobono, and you will die.'</p>

<p>The secretary had already such belief in the power of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
those who knew the magic words that he turned pale
and the cold sweat stood on his forehead.</p>

<p>'If all this were to be done to me now,' he faltered, 'I
could not tell you what the master intends!'</p>

<p>She saw that it was the truth.</p>

<p>'Very well,' she said; 'then you must manage that he
shall come here to-day as soon as he returns from Polo's
house.'</p>

<p>'I will tell him that you have asked to see him&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No. Tell him that I shall fall ill if I am shut up in
these rooms any longer, and that if he does not believe
it, he had better come and see how I am. He will
probably take your advice. I do not choose to show you
my face, but I assure you I am very pale, and I have
no appetite.'</p>

<p>'He will come,' said the secretary confidently.</p>

<p>'You can also do me another service, Omobono,'
continued Zoë. 'I have learned that last Friday, when
you went to find Rustan about buying me, you came upon
him in the beggars' quarter, near the church of Saint
Sergius and Saint Bacchus, at a house where some very
poor people lived. This is true, is it not?'</p>

<p>Omobono nodded, wondering how she knew of the
circumstance.</p>

<p>'A poor woman lay there ill, with children and a very
old nurse, and Rustan gave them something. I wish to
know how these poor people are, and where they live,
if they have left that house. I am sure the master is
charitable, and will let you give them something if
they are still in need. There were two little boys, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
there was a grown girl besides the sick woman and the
other.'</p>

<p>'You know everything!' cried Omobono. 'The man
must be a great astrologer! I will go myself to the beggars'
quarter and do your bidding.'</p>

<p>Zoë had played her little comedy because she had by
this time guessed the man's character, and wished to
make sure that she could rely on his help in anything she
decided to do; for it was clear that whenever Zeno was
absent, the secretary was in charge of the whole establishment,
and the servants would obey him without hesitation.
As Gorlias had told him, whatever he did was
right in their eyes.</p>

<p>That he was in haste to do her bidding she discovered
before the afternoon was half over, for as she sat in her
window she saw him go down to wait for his master at the
marble steps, and he walked slowly on the strip of black
and white pavement by the water's edge.</p>

<p>At last he stood still, and looked towards Blachernæ,
for the skiff was in sight. Zoë drew her veil across her
face and rested her head against the right-hand side of the
open window as if she were very tired, and she did not
move from this position as the boat came near. Zeno
was leaning back in the stern, and could not help seeing
her as he approached the house, but from her attitude he
thought she did not see him, and he looked up at her
steadily for two or three seconds. She was quite motionless.</p>

<p>Omobono stood by the water's edge as Zeno stepped
ashore, and asked permission to say a few words to him
at once. Zeno dismissed the boat by a gesture.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<p>'Has anything happened?' he asked, glancing up at
the window again.</p>

<p>Zoë had not moved, but she could see him through her
veil. Then the two men walked up and down, while
Omobono spoke in a low tone, but though she could not
hear the words she knew what the substance was. Then
came Zeno's voice, cold and clear.</p>

<p>'Certainly not,' he said decidedly. 'I shall do nothing
of the sort! If she has no appetite send for a doctor.
Do you take me for one? Send for old Solomon the
Jewish physician. He is the best, and he is an old man.
If he says the girl needs air, take her out in the boat, her
and the maids, on fine mornings.'</p>

<p>A question from Omobono followed, which Zoë could
not hear distinctly. Zeno was evidently annoyed.</p>

<p>'Omobono, you are a good man,' he said; 'but you
have no more sense than a cackling hen! Never think!
It is not your strong point. When you do just what I
tell you, you never make a mistake.'</p>

<p>The secretary's voice was heard again, low and indistinct.</p>

<p>'No,' answered Zeno. 'You need not go and tell her
what I have said, for she has probably heard every word
of it herself, from the window. It is useless ever to tell
women anything. They always know before they are
told.'</p>

<p>Thereupon Zeno went in, apparently in a bad temper.
If anything can make a woman angry when she is overhearing
a conversation about herself, it is to hear it
said that she is undoubtedly listening. Zoë had not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
hidden herself, and Zeno must have meant her to hear
what he was saying, but she felt the more deeply insulted.
Her cheek burned, and she drew back her veil to feel the
cool air. So he had no intention of coming to see her
again! A Jewish doctor and an airing in the boat, with
Omobono for company! And she had been told that she
had been listening&mdash;it was not to be borne! She threw
her veil on one side, her silk shawl on the other, and then
walked up and down the long room with restless steps,
like a young wild animal in a cage.</p>

<p>The little maids picked up the things and watched her
uneasily, for she had always seemed very gentle. They
looked at her with wide eyes now, and their gaze irritated
her, till she felt that she wanted to box their ears, and
wished she had the negress's whip in her belt. Then,
without any apparent reason, she threw her arms round
the one that stood nearest and kissed the astonished girl
a dozen times, almost lifting her from the floor. As she
let her go, she laughed nervously at herself.</p>

<p>She was thirsty, and she drank off a tall glass of cold
water at a draught; and all the time she was unconsciously
repeating one phrase to herself.</p>

<p>'He shall pay me for this, he shall pay me for
this!'</p>

<p>The words rang in her ears, to a sort of silly tune that
would not go away. There is a vile natural hurdy-gurdy
somewhere in our brains, and when we are angry,
or in love, or broken-hearted, or otherwise beside ourselves,
it plays its absurd little tunes at us till we are ready
to go mad. I sometimes think that devil's music may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
have brought on the final fatal irritation against life,
that has decided the fate of many half-mad suicides.</p>

<p>'He shall pay me for this!' She heard the words keeping
time with her movements; she walked slower&mdash;faster,
but it made no difference, for the infernal little
notes took the beat from her steps.</p>

<p>She had not the least notion how Zeno was to pay for
having made her so very angry, and that question did not
obtrude itself on her thoughts till her temper was beginning
to subside; then she suddenly felt how utterly
helpless she was, and her wrath boiled up again. The
only way of paying him out that suggested itself was to
throw herself out of the window. Then he would be
sorry for what he had done.</p>

<p>Would he? He would probably send Omobono to
have her corpse taken away as quickly as possible. And
the day after to-morrow he would go again to see Giustina
Polo in her father's house, and she would have
thrown herself out of the window for nothing. Besides,
it would be wicked.</p>

<p>She realised how childish her thoughts were, and she
sat down to think&mdash;'like a grown-up woman,' she said to
herself. But just then she remembered Zeno's words to
Omobono. 'Never think, for it is not your strong point,'
he had said to his secretary; but he had of course meant
it for her. Everything had been meant for her. She
wished she could hold his brown throat in her hands and
dig her little nails into it.</p>

<p>Appetite, indeed! Was it strange that she should not
be hungry? How could any one eat who lived such a life,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
shut up between four walls?&mdash;with a tyrant downstairs
who did not even take the trouble to come and look at
her, but sent his silly old clerk to keep her company!
He took trouble enough to go and see Giustina Polo!</p>

<p>This was thinking 'like a grown-up woman,' as she
had proposed to do! She was disgusted with herself,
and looked about for something to occupy her thoughts.
There were sweetmeats, whole boxes of sweetmeats of
every sort. Twice already they had been emptied and
refilled with fresh ones, since she had been brought to the
house. That was Zeno's idea of what a woman needed
to occupy her thoughts and be happy! Sweetmeats!
Preserve of rose-leaves! Figs in syrup! That was all
he knew of her wants!</p>

<p>She lay back among her cushions, her brown eyes
gleamed angrily, her lips were a little parted, and her
nostrils quivered now and then as she drew a sharp
breath. Presently, she called Yulia to her side.</p>

<p>'Go to the secretary,' she said, 'and tell him to send
me a book.'</p>

<p>'A book?' repeated the slave stupidly, for she had
never seen a woman who could read.</p>

<p>'Yes. A book in Greek, Latin, or Italian; it does not
matter which. I am sick of doing nothing. Tell him
to be quick, too,' she added, in a tone of authority.</p>

<p>The girl tripped away and found Omobono in the
counting-house on the ground floor. He was in a bad
humour too, but in his case it took the form of dignified
sorrow. His master had compared him to a fowl, and
to one that cackled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>'What does she want with a book?' he asked, in a
dreary tone, looking up from his accounts.</p>

<p>'To read, I think, sir,' answered the little maid timidly;
'and she told me to beg you to let her have it soon.'</p>

<p>'As if a slave could read!' He looked about him in a
melancholy way, and rose to take from the shelf above
his head a good-sized volume bound in soft brown leather,
with little thongs tied in slip knots, for clasps, to keep it
shut.</p>

<p>'Take her that,' he said, thrusting the book into the
girl's hands.</p>

<p>Yulia took it, and before she had left the room Omobono
was gravely busy with his figures again; but each
time he added up a column the sum seemed to be 'cackling
hen,' instead of anything reasonable. But Yulia
ran upstairs.</p>

<p>Zoë untied the thongs and opened the book in the
middle. An exclamation of anger and disgust escaped
her lips. The secretary, who did not believe she could
really read, though she spoke Latin fluently, had sent an
old volume of accounts in answer to her request. There
were pages and pages of entries and columns of figures,
all neatly written in his small, clear hand, on stout cotton
paper. Here and there some one else had made a note,
as if checking his work.</p>

<p>Zoë pushed the book away from her on the divan, and
it fell over the edge and lay face downwards and open
on the floor. Then the little tune began again in her
head.</p>

<p>'He shall pay me for this!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>She wished he would open the door noiselessly and be
all at once beside her, as on that first evening. That
had been Friday, and to-day was Wednesday; five days
had gone by. Counting Friday there were six, and six
days were practically a week! She had been under his
roof a whole week and he had only cared to see her face
once.</p>

<p>'He shall pay me for this!'</p>

<p>The tune went on, and she quite forgot how she had
longed for death, and how his first anticipated coming
had been dreadful beyond anything she had ever suffered,
beyond cold, starvation, and misery. Or if she remembered
it at all, she told herself that the man she had seen
was not the kind of man she had expected, and that she
had nothing to fear from him. She was quite sure of
that.</p>

<p>She turned on one side, as she half lay on the divan,
till she could reach the account-book to pick it up. One
of the maids jumped up from the carpet to help
her.</p>

<p>'Go away!' she exclaimed crossly, for she had got
hold of the cover and had drawn the volume over the
edge of the divan. 'I will call if I want anything.'</p>

<p>The girls slipped away in silence and left her alone.
She turned over the pages with a sort of angry curiosity,
half expecting to find an entry concerning slaves bought
and sold like herself. Just then she could have believed
Zeno capable of anything.</p>

<p>But though she found a great many strange words
which she did not understand, and which referred to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
tonnage, insurance, profit and loss, and all the complicated
matters of an Eastern merchant's business,
there was nothing which could possibly be interpreted
to mean that Zeno had dealt in humanity, as most of
the Venetians who lived in Constantinople certainly did.
Sebastian Polo's name occurred very often. Large sums
had been paid to him, and other large sums had been received
from him. It was clear that the two men were in
close relations of business, and constantly made ventures
together, dividing the profits and sharing the losses.</p>

<p>That might account for Zeno's constant visits to his
fellow-merchant, though Zoë was not inclined to admit
such a view. On the contrary, she made herself believe
that Zeno dealt with Polo solely in order to make
an excuse for seeing more of the latter's daughter. He
should pay for that, too! The little tune hammered
away in her head at a great rate.</p>

<p>She clapped her hands.</p>

<p>'Take this back to the secretary,' she said, giving the
book to Yulia. 'Tell him I am not a merchant's clerk,
and that I want something to read.'</p>

<p>Again little Yulia tripped downstairs to the ground
floor. But the counting-house was locked, and the
men-servants told her that Omobono had gone out. She
would not leave the book with them, for she had a superstitiously
exaggerated idea of the value of all written
things; therefore, after a moment's hesitation, she turned
and carried it upstairs again, though she did not like the
idea of facing her mistress.</p>

<p>At the first landing she almost ran against the master
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of the house, who asked her what she was carrying and
where she was going. He spoke rather sharply, and
Yulia was frightened and told him the whole story, explaining
that Zoë seemed to be in a bad temper, and
would be angry with her for bringing back the account-book,
but that it was Omobono's fault. How could he
dare to suppose that the Kokóna could not read? And
why was he out? And if he was not out why had the
men-servants told her that he was?</p>

<p>The little slave did as all slaves and servants naturally
do when they wish to gain favour with the master;
she hinted that all the other servants in the house were
in league to do evil, and that she only was righteous.
Zeno carelessly looked through the pages of the account-book
as he stood listening to her tale.</p>

<p>'You talk too much,' he observed, when she paused.
'Go upstairs.'</p>

<p>Thereupon he turned his back on her and went in
under the heavy curtain to his own room, taking the
book with him and leaving Yulia considerably disconcerted.
She looked at the curtain disconsolately for a
few seconds, and then slowly ascended the second flight
of steps to the women's apartments.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Zeno himself followed her, with
another book in his hand. He knocked discreetly at the
outer door, and Lucilla opened, for Yulia was still explaining
to Zoë what had happened. The maid stood
aside to let the master pass through the vestibule which
separated the inner rooms from the staircase. Zeno
raised the curtain and went in.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>'I am no great reader,' he said, as he came forward
towards the divan, 'but I have brought you this old book.
It may amuse you. The man died more than fifty years
ago, and I fancy he was mad; but there must be something
in his poem, for it has been copied again and again.
This was given me by the Emperor Charles when I was
with him in Venice.'</p>

<p>Zoë had time to recover from her surprise and to study
his face and manner while he spoke, and again she was
convinced that he was a little shy in her presence. If
she changed colour at all he did not see it, for though
he glanced at her two or three times, he looked more
often at the book he held. As he finished speaking he
placed it in her hands and his eyes met hers.</p>

<p>Possibly Zoë had guessed that if she could make a
stir in the house by sending messages to Omobono, the
master would at last come in person; at all events she
felt a little thrill of triumph when he was before her
bringing his book and speaking pleasantly, as a sort of
peace-offering for having neglected her so long.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said she, very sweetly. 'Will it please
your lordship to be seated?'</p>

<p>Yulia had pushed forward a large fold-stool, and Zoë
motioned to her and her companion to sit down in a
corner. Zeno thought she had sent them out of the
room, and he looked round and saw them squatting on
their carpet, side by side.</p>

<p>'Shall I send them away?' asked Zoë, with a sweet
smile.</p>

<p>'They are not in the way,' Zeno answered coldly;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
for he felt that they might be if they understood, but
nothing would have induced him to dismiss them just
then.</p>

<p>A little pause followed, during which Zoë opened the
manuscript and read the illuminated title-page.</p>

<p>'It is dull for you, here,' said Carlo awkwardly.</p>

<p>Zoë did not even look up, and affected to answer
absently, while she turned over the pages.</p>

<p>'Oh no!' she said. 'Not in the least, I assure you!'
She went back to the title and read it aloud. '"The
Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri"&mdash;I have heard his
name. A Sicilian, was he not? Or a Lombard? I
cannot remember. Have you read the poetry? The
paintings are very pretty, I see. There is much more
life in Italian painting than in our stiff pictures with
their gilt backgrounds. Of course, there is a certain
childlike simplicity about them, an absence of school, of
the traditions of good masters, of reverence for the old
art! But they mean something that is, whereas our
Greek pictures mean something that never was. Do
you agree with me?'</p>

<p>She had talked on in a careless tone, toying with the
book, and only looking up as she asked a question without
waiting for a reply. By the time she paused she had
asked so many that Zeno only noticed the last.</p>

<p>'You would like Venice,' he said, 'but you would like
Florence better. There are good pictures there, I believe.'</p>

<p>'You have not seen them yourself?'</p>

<p>'Oh yes! But I do not understand such things.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
This man Alighieri describes some of them in his book.
He was a Florentine.'</p>

<p>As Zeno showed himself more willing to talk, Zoë
seemed to grow more indifferent. She laid the book
down beside her, leaned back, and looked out of the window,
turning her face half away from him. It was the
first time he had seen her by daylight since she had
come, and the strong afternoon light glowed in her white
skin, her eyes, and her brown hair. He could have seen
on her cheek the very smallest imperfection, had it been
as tiny as the point of a pin, but there was none. He
looked at her tender mouth; and in the strong glare he
could have detected the least roughness on her lips, if
they had not been as smooth as fresh fruit. Moreover,
the line from her ear to her neck was really as perfect as
it had seemed at first sight. Her nervous, high-bred
young hand lay on the folds of her over-garment, within
his reach, and he felt much inclined to take it and hold
it. He did not remember that any woman's near
presence had disturbed him in the same way, nor had
he ever hesitated on the few occasions in his life when he
had been inclined to take a woman's hand. He had the
fullest rights which the laws of the Empire could give
him, for Arethusa, as he called her, was his property
out-and-out, and if he died suddenly she would be sold
at auction with the furniture. Yet, for some wholly
inexplicable reason he did not quite dare to touch the
tips of her fingers.</p>

<p>'I have heard that you are a hero,' Zoë observed,
without looking at him. 'Is it true?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>

<p>Then she turned her eyes to him and smiled a little
maliciously, he fancied, as if she had guessed his timidity
from his silence.</p>

<p>'Who told you such nonsense?' Zeno asked, with a
laugh, for her question had broken the ice&mdash;or perhaps
had quenched the fire for a while. 'I am a man like any
other!'</p>

<p>'That I doubt, sir,' answered Zoë, laughing too,
though not much.</p>

<p>'You have no experience of men,' he said. 'They
are all like me, I assure you. One sheep is not more
like another in a flock.'</p>

<p>'I should not have taken you for one of the common
herd. Besides, I know of your deeds in Italy and Greece,
and how you fought a Turkish army for a whole year with
a handful of men&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have seen some fighting, of course,' Zeno replied.
'But that is all in the past. I am a sober, peace-loving
Venetian merchant now, and nothing else.'</p>

<p>'It must be very dull to be a sober, peace-loving
Venetian merchant,' said Zoë, faintly mimicking his
tone.</p>

<p>'Making money is too hard work to be dull.'</p>

<p>'I suppose so. And then,' she added, with magnificent
calm, 'I have always heard that avarice is the
passion of old age.'</p>

<p>Zeno fell into the trap.</p>

<p>'Dear me!' he cried in astonishment. 'How old do
you think I am?'</p>

<p>Zoë looked at him quietly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>'I have no experience of men,' she said, with perfect
gravity, 'but from your manner, sir, I should judge you
to be&mdash;about fifty.'</p>

<p>Zeno's jaw dropped, for she spoke so naturally and
quietly that he could not believe she was laughing at him.</p>

<p>'I shall be twenty-nine in August,' he answered.</p>

<p>'Only twenty-nine?' Zoë affected great surprise.
'I should have thought you were much, much older!
Are you quite sure?'</p>

<p>'Yes.' Carlo laughed. 'I am quite sure. But I
suppose I seem very old to you.'</p>

<p>'Oh yes! Very!' She nodded gravely as she spoke.</p>

<p>'You are seventeen, are you not?' Zeno asked.</p>

<p>'How in the world should I know!' she enquired.
'Is not my age set down in the receipt Rustan gave you
with me? How should a slave know her own age, sir?
And if we knew it, do you think that any of us could speak
the truth, except under torture? It would not be worth
while to dislocate my arms and burn my feet with hot
irons, just to know how old I am, would it? You could
not even sell me again, if I had once been tortured!'</p>

<p>'What horrible ideas you have! Imagine torturing
this little thing!'</p>

<p>Thereupon, without warning, he took her hand in his
and looked at it. She made a very slight instinctive
movement to withdraw it, and then it lay quite still and
passive.</p>

<p>'I am sure I could never bear pain,' she said, smiling.
'I should tell everything at once! I should never make
a good conspirator. I suppose you must have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
wounded once or twice, when you were young. Tell me,
did it hurt very much?'</p>

<p>He let her hand fall as he answered, and she drew it
back and hid it under her wide sleeve.</p>

<p>'A cut with a sharp sword feels like a stream of icy-cold
water,' he answered. 'A thrust through the flesh
pricks like a big thorn, and pricks again when the point
comes out on the other side. One feels very little, or
nothing at all, if one is badly wounded in the head, for
one is stunned at once; it is the headache afterwards
that really hurts. If one is wounded in the lungs, one
feels nothing, but one is choked by the blood, and one
must turn on one's face at once in order not to suffocate.
Broken bones hurt afterwards as a rule, more than at
first, but it is a curious sensation to have one's collar
bone smashed by a blow from a two-handed sword&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Good heavens!' cried Zoë. 'What a catalogue!
How do you know how each thing feels?'</p>

<p>'I can remember,' Zeno answered simply.</p>

<p>'You have been wounded in all those different ways,
and you are alive?'</p>

<p>Zeno smiled.</p>

<p>'Yes; and you understand now why I look so old.'</p>

<p>'I was not in earnest,' Zoë said. 'You knew that I
was not. You need only look at yourself in a mirror
to see that I was laughing.'</p>

<p>'I was not very deeply hurt by being taken for a man
of fifty,' Zeno answered, not quite truthfully.</p>

<p>'Oh no!' laughed Zoë. 'I cannot imagine that my
opinion of your age could make any difference to you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
It was silly of me&mdash;only, for a man who has had so
many adventures, you do look absurdly young!'</p>

<p>'So much the better, since my fighting days are over.'</p>

<p>'And since you are a sober, peace-loving merchant,'
said Zoë, continuing the sentence for him. 'But are
you so very sure, my lord? Would nothing make you
draw your sword again and risk your life on your fencing?
Nothing?'</p>

<p>'Nothing that did not affect my honour, I truly believe.'</p>

<p>'You would not do it for a woman's sake?' She turned
to him, to watch his face, but its expression did not
change.</p>

<p>'Three things can drive a wise man mad,&mdash;wine,
women, and dice.'</p>

<p>'I daresay! Your lordship reckons us in good company.
But that is no answer to my question.'</p>

<p>'Yes it is,' said Zeno with a laugh. 'Why should I do
for a woman what I would not do for dice or wine?'</p>

<p>'But dice and wine never tempted you,' Zoë objected.</p>

<p>Zeno laughed louder.</p>

<p>'Never? When I was a student at Padua I sold everything,
even my books, to get money for both. It was
only when the books were gone that I turned soldier,
and learned the greatest game of hazard in the world.
Compared with that, dice are an opiate, and wine is a
sleeping-draught.'</p>

<p>He only smiled now, after laughing, but there was a
look in his face as he spoke which she saw then for the
first time and did not forget, and recognised when she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
saw it again. It was subtle, and might have passed
unnoticed among men, but it spoke to the sex in the girl,
and made her young blood thrill. For worlds, she would
not have had him guess what she felt just then.</p>

<p>'Fighting for its own sake would tempt you, if nothing
else could,' she answered quietly.</p>

<p>'Ah&mdash;perhaps, perhaps,' he answered, musing.</p>

<p>'But you would need a cause, though ever so slight,
and you have none here, have you?'</p>

<p>'None that I care to take up.'</p>

<p>'You may find something to fight for&mdash;over the
water,' Zoë suggested, emphasising the words a little
and watching his face.</p>

<p>The phrase meant nothing to him.</p>

<p>'Over the water?' he repeated carelessly. 'At home,
in Venice, you mean. Yes, if Venice needed me, I
should not wait to be called twice!'</p>

<p>It was quite clear that he attached no meaning to the
words she had used, and this fact tallied with what the
astrologer had told her in the morning as to his having
been deaf to all advances made to him by the imprisoned
Emperor's party.</p>

<p>Zoë leaned back in silence for a while, almost closing
her eyes, and she saw that he watched her, and that an
unmistakable look of admiration stole into his face. She
was wondering whether it would ever turn into something
more, and whether she should ever see the gleam of
fight in his eyes, for her sake, that had flashed in them a
moment ago at the mere thought of battle. What did
women do, to make men love them? There is an age
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
when girls believe that love need only be called, like a
tame dove, and that he will fly in at the window; and
there is an age when he comes to them uncalled-for. If
only the ages were the same for all, much trouble might
be spared. Zoë was perhaps between the two, but she
still believed that there was some fixed rule on which
clever women acted to make men fall in love with them,
those wicked women who are described to young girls
as 'designing,' and are supposed to know precisely the
effect they can produce on men at any moment, to the
very nicety of an eyelash.</p>

<p>Zeno broke the long silence with an unexpected speech
which roughly awakened Zoë from her reflection.</p>

<p>'As for this Emperor John whom his son has locked
up,' he said, 'his friends have done their best to interest
me in his cause. He has even sent me messages, begging
me to help him to escape. Why? What difference can
it make to me whether he or his son dies in the Amena
tower? They are poor things, both of them, and for all
I care John may starve in his chains before I will lift
a finger!'</p>

<p>Zoë sighed and bit her lip to check herself, for his
voluntary declaration had dashed the palace of her
hopes to pieces in an instant.</p>

<p>Then she was ashamed of having even dreamt that he
might love her, since he despised the very cause for
which she had wished to win his love. But this state of
mind did not last long, either. She was too brave to
let such a speech pass, as if she agreed with it.</p>

<p>'You are wrong,' she said, quite forgetting that she had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
set herself to play the part of the slave. 'You ought
to help him, if you can&mdash;and you can, if you will.'</p>

<p>Zeno looked at her in surprise. There was something
like authority in her tone, and the two little maids, whom
he had forgotten in their corner behind him, stared in
astonishment at her audacity. Not a word of the conversation
had escaped them.</p>

<p>'I mean,' continued Zoë, before he could find an answer
to her plain statement, 'if you are a true Venetian you
should wish to put down the man whom the Genoese
and the Turks have set on the throne. Johannes is your
friend and your country's friend, though he is a weak
man and always will be. Andronicus is an enemy to
Venice and a friend to her enemies. He is even now ready
to give the island of Tenedos to them&mdash;the key to the
Dardanelles&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What?' asked Zeno in a loud and angry tone.
'Tenedos?'</p>

<p>His manner had changed, and he almost rose from his
seat as he bent forwards and seized her wrist in his
excitement. She was glad, and smiled at him.</p>

<p>'Yes,' she answered, 'the Genoese demand it as the
price of their protection, and they will force him to give
it to them. But it may not be easy, for the governor of
the island is loyal to Johannes.'</p>

<p>'How do you know these things?' asked Zeno, still
holding her wrist and trying to look into her eyes.</p>

<p>'I know them,' Zoë answered. 'If I am not telling
you the truth, sell me in the market to-morrow.'</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_189" id="i_189"></a>
<img src="images/i_189.jpg" width="538" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">'I know them,' Zoë answered. 'If I am not telling you the truth, sell me in the
market to-morrow.'</p>
</div>

<p>'By the Evangelist,' swore Zeno, 'you will deserve it.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p>A month had passed, and yet, to all outward appearance,
Zeno's manner of living had undergone
no change. He rose early and bathed in the
Golden Horn on fine days. He attended to his business
in the morning, and dined with Sebastian Polo twice a
week, but generally at home on the remaining days;
and he rode out in the afternoon with a single running
footman, or stayed indoors if it rained. Even his own
servants and slaves hardly noticed any change in his
habits, and only observed that he often looked preoccupied,
and sometimes sat on his balcony for an hour
without moving, his eyes fixed on the towers of the
Blachernæ palace.</p>

<p>They did not know how much time he spent with his
beautiful Greek slave; and they found that the two little
maids, Yulia and Lucilla, were not inclined to gossip
when they came downstairs on an errand. Omobono
probably knew a good deal, but he kept it to himself,
and stored the fruits of his lively curiosity to enjoy alone
the delicious sensation of the miser gloating over his
useless gold. On the whole, therefore, life in the Venetian
merchant's house had gone on much as usual for
a whole month after Zoë had fired a train which was
destined to produce momentous results when it reached
the mine at last.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span></p>

<p>Zeno saw her every day now, and often twice, and she
had become a part of his life, and necessary to him; though
he did not believe that he was in love with her, any more
than she would have admitted that she loved him.</p>

<p>For each was possessed by one dominant thought;
and it chanced, as it rarely chances in real life, that one
deed, if it could be performed, would satisfy the hopes
of both. Zeno, born patriot and leader, saw that the
whole influence of his country in the East was at stake
in the matter of Tenedos; Zoë thirsted to revenge the
death of Michael Rhangabé, her adopted father and the
idol of her childhood.</p>

<p>If the imprisoned Emperor Johannes could be delivered
from the Amena tower, both would certainly
obtain what they most desired. Johannes would give
Tenedos to Venice, in gratitude for his liberty, and the
people of Constantinople would probably tear Andronicus
to ribands in the Hippodrome, on the very spot
where Rhangabé had suffered.</p>

<p>They would rally round their lawful sovereign if he
could only be got out of the precincts of the palace,
where the usurper was strongly guarded by his foreign
mercenaries, mostly Circassians, Mingrelians, Avars, and
Slavonians. The people would not rise of themselves
to storm Blachernæ, nor would the Greek troops revolt
of their own accord; but as they all feared the soldiers
of the foreign legion, they hated them and their master
Andronicus, and the presence of Johannes amongst
them would restore their courage and make the issue
certain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<p>Such a leader as Carlo Zeno might indeed have successfully
besieged Andronicus in his palace; but he knew,
and every man and woman in Constantinople knew well
enough, that Andronicus would make an end of his
father and of his two younger brothers in prison, at the
first sign of a revolution, so that there might be no lawful
heir to the throne left alive but he himself.</p>

<p>Therefore it was the first and the chief object of the
patriots to bring Johannes secretly from his place of
confinement to the heart of the city, or to one of the
islands, beyond the reach of danger, till the revolution
should be over and his son a prisoner in his stead; though
it was much more probable that the latter would be
summarily put to death as a traitor.</p>

<p>All this Zeno had understood before Zoë had spoken
to him about it; but he had not known that the Genoese
had demanded Tenedos of Andronicus as the price of
their protection against the Turks; for the negotiations
had been kept very secret, and at first Carlo had not
believed the girl, and had deemed that the tale might
be a pure invention.</p>

<p>He had come again to see her on the following day, and
again he had vainly tried to find out who she was, and
in what great Fanariote house she had been brought up.
It was impossible to get a word from her on this subject;
and she warned him that what she had told him must not
be repeated in the hearing of any Genoese, nor of any one
connected with the Court. The Genoese meant that no
one should know of the treaty till it was carried out, and
until Tenedos was theirs; for the place was very strong,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
as they afterwards found by experience, and Andronicus
needed their help too much to risk losing their favour
by an indiscretion.</p>

<p>These injunctions of silence made Carlo still more
doubtful as to the veracity of Zoë's story, and he
frankly told her so and demanded proof; but she only
answered as she had at first.</p>

<p>'If it is not true,' she said, 'brand me in the forehead,
as they brand thieves, and sell me in the open
market.'</p>

<p>And again he was angry, and swore that he would do
so by her indeed if the story was a lie; but she smiled
confidently, and nodded her assent.</p>

<p>'If you do not save the Emperor,' she said, 'you
Venetians will be driven out of Constantinople before
many months; and if Genoa once holds Tenedos how
shall you ever again sail up the Dardanelles?'</p>

<p>Many a time she had heard Michael Rhangabé say as
much to his friends, and she knew that it was wisdom.
So did Zeno, and he wondered at the knowledge of his
bought slave. So he came and went, turning over the
great question in his brain; and she awaited his coming
gladly, because she saw that he was roused, and because
the longing for just revenge was uppermost in her
thoughts. Thus were the two drawn together more and
more, fate helping. Yet he told her nothing of the steps
he took so quickly after he had once made up his mind
to act.</p>

<p>She no longer asked him what he meant to do with her;
she did not again send for the secretary to complain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
that her existence was dull; she no longer was impatient
with her maids; she seemed perfectly satisfied with her
existence.</p>

<p>She went out when she pleased to go, in the beautiful
skiff, in charge of Omobono, and always with one of the
girls; and she sat in the deep cushioned seat as the great
ladies did when they were rowed to the Sweet Waters,
and as she had sat many times in old days, beside Kyría
Agatha. The secretary sat on a little movable seat in
the waist of the boat, which was built almost exactly
like a modern Venetian gondola without the hood, and
the slave-girl sat in the bottom at her mistress's feet.
Zoë, the adopted daughter of the Protosparthos, had
gone abroad with uncovered face, but Arethusa, the slave,
was closely veiled, though that was not the general custom.
And often, as she glided along in the spring afternoons,
she passed people she had known only a year ago,
or a little more, who wondered why she hid her features;
or told each other, as was more or less true, that she was
some handsome white slave, whose jealous master would
not suffer her beauty to be seen. For it was clear that
Omobono was only a respectable elderly person placed
in charge of her.</p>

<p>The two generally conversed in Latin, and the secretary
told her of his search for Kyría Agatha, the children,
and old Nectaria. She had never shown him her face
since she had been a slave, and she believed that he did
not connect her with the ragged girl he had seen bending
over the sick woman's bed in the beggars' quarter. She
had enjoined upon him the greatest discretion in case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
he found the little family, and with Omobono such an
injunction was quite unnecessary, for outward discretion
is the characteristic quality of curiosity, which is inwardly
the least discreet of failings. People who look
through keyholes, listen behind curtains, and read other
people's letters are generally the last to talk of what they
learn in that way.</p>

<p>As yet, the secretary's search had been fruitless, but
he had long ago made up his mind that Zoë was Kyría
Agatha's daughter. The bandy-legged sacristan of Saint
Bacchus had helped him to this conclusion by informing
him that Rustan Karaboghazji had not come to perform
his devotions in the church for some time; never, in
fact, since that Friday afternoon on which Omobono
had inquired after him.</p>

<p>The secretary had searched the beggars' quarter in vain.
He remembered the ruined house very well, and the crazy
shutters with bits of rain-bleached string tied to them
for fastenings. There were people living in it, but they
were not the same beggars; it was now inhabited by the
chief physician of the beggars himself, whose business
it was to prepare misery for the public eye, at fixed rates.
For among those who were really starving there lived a
small tribe of professional paupers, who displayed the
horrors of their loathsome diseases at the doors of the
churches all over Constantinople. The physician was
skilful in his way, and though he preferred a real cripple,
or a real sore for his art to improve upon, he could produce
the semblance of either on sound limbs and a whole skin,
though the process was expensive. Yet that increased
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
cost was balanced by the ability of his healthy patients
to go alone to a great distance, and thus to vary the
scene of their industry. They thus picked up the charity
which should have reached the real poor, most of whom
could hardly crawl as far as the great thoroughfares more
than once or twice a week, at the risk of their lives.
The sham beggar always has a marvellous power of covering
the ground, but you must generally seek the real
one in the lair where he is dying. Omobono had learnt
much about beggars which he had not known before
then, and he had found no trace whatever of the people
whom he was seeking.</p>

<p>They seemed very far away when Zoë thought of them.
She wondered whether any of them missed her, except
Nectaria, now that they had warm clothes and plenty to
eat. The sacrifice had been very terrible at first,&mdash;it
did not seem so now; and she knew that on that very
afternoon when she went home after being out in the
boat, she would listen for Zeno's footstep in the vestibule,
and think the time long till he came.</p>

<p>But Omobono had gathered a good deal of information
about her from his acquaintance, the sacristan, whom
he strongly suspected of being in league with Rustan
to inform him when there was anything worth buying
in the beggars' quarter; for the Bokharian was a busy
man, and had no time to spend in searching for unusual
merchandise, nor, when there was any to be had, would
it have been to his advantage to be seen often in its
neighborhood. So he paid the sacristan to quarter the
ground continually for him, while he was engaged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
elsewhere. It is to the credit of Rustan's splendid business
intelligence that the system he employed has not
been improved on in five hundred years; for when the
modern slave-dealers make their annual journeys to the
centres of supply they find everything ready for them, like
any other commercial traveller.</p>

<p>Having understood Rustan's mode of procedure,
Omobono had extracted from the sacristan such information
as the latter possessed about Zoë and Kyría
Agatha, but that was not very much after all. They
had lived three or four weeks in the ruined house, or
perhaps six; he could not remember exactly. At first
they all came to the church, but they had sold their
miserable clothes and their wretched belongings. The
last time the girl had come, she had been alone, and she
had worn a blanket over her shoulders to keep her warm.
That had been at dusk. Then Rustan had bought her,
and soon afterwards they must have gone away, since
the beggars' physician was now installed in the house.
Why should the sacristan take any interest in them?
They were gone, and Constantinople was a vast city.
No, the woman had not died, for he would have known it.
When people died they were buried, even if they had
starved to death in the beggars' quarter.</p>

<p>Zoë thanked Omobono for the information, and
begged him to continue her search. He wondered why
she did not burst into tears, and concluded that she was
either quite heartless, or was in love with Zeno, or both.
He inclined to the latter theory. Love, he told himself
with all the conviction of middle-aged inexperience, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
a selfish passion. Zoë loved Zeno, and did not care what
had become of her mother.</p>

<p>Besides, he knew that she was jealous. She had heard
of Giustina, and was determined to see her. She insisted
that the boat should keep to the left, going up the
Golden Horn, and she made the secretary point out
Sebastian Polo's dwelling. It was a small palace, a
hundred yards below the gardens of Blachernæ, and it
had marble steps, like those at Zeno's house. A girl
with dyed hair sat in the shade in an upper balcony;
her hair was red auburn, like that of the Venetian women,
and her face was white, but that was all Zoë could see.
She wished she had a hawk's eyes. Omobono said it
might be Giustina, but as the latter had many friends,
it might also be one of them, for most Venetian women
had hair of that colour.</p>

<p>Farther up, they neared Blachernæ, and came first to
the great Amena tower, of which the foundations stood
on an escarped pier in the water. Zoë looked up,
trying to guess the height of the upper windows from the
water, but she had no experience, and they were very
high&mdash;perhaps a hundred palms, perhaps fifty&mdash;Zeno
would know. Could he get up there by a rope? She
wondered, and she thought of what she should feel if
she herself were hanging there in mid-air by a single rope
against the smooth wall. Then in her imagination she
saw Zeno half-way up, and some one cut the line above,
for he was discovered, and he fell. A painful thrill ran
down the back of her neck and her spine and through
her limbs, and she shrank in her seat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span></p>

<p>It was up there, in the highest story, that Johannes
had been a prisoner nearly two years. The windows
needed no gratings, for it would be death to leap out,
and no one could climb up to get in. The pier below
the tower sloped to the stream, and its base ran out so
far that no man could have jumped clear of it from above&mdash;even
if he dared the desperate risk of striking the
water. Bertrandon de la Broquière saw it, years afterwards,
when Zeno was an old man, and you may look at
a good picture of it in his illuminated book.</p>

<p>A solitary fisherman was perched on the edge of the
sloping pier, apparently hindered from slipping off by
the very slight projection of the lowest course of stones,
which was perpendicular. His brown legs were bare far
above the knee, he wore a brown fisherman's coat of a
woollen stuff, not woven but fulled like felt; a wide hat
of sennet, sewn round and round a small crown of tarred
sailcloth, flapped over his ears. He angled in the slow
stream with a long reed and a short line.</p>

<p>Zoë looked at him attentively as the boat passed near
him, and she saw that he was watching her, too, from
under the limp brim of his queer hat.</p>

<p>Her left hand hung over the gunwale of the skiff, and
when she was opposite the fisherman she wetted her
fingers and carelessly raised them to her lips as if she were
tasting the drops. The man instantly replied by waving
his rod over the water thrice, and he cast his short line
each time. She had seen his mouth and chin and scanty
beard below the hanging brim of his hat, and she had
fancied that she recognised him; she had no doubt of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
now. The solitary fisherman was Gorlias Pietrogliant,
the astrologer.</p>

<p>Omobono had scarcely noticed him, for his own natural
curiosity made him look steadily up at the high windows,
on the chance that the imperial prisoner might look out
just then. He had seen him once or twice before the
revolution, and wondered whether he was much changed
by his long confinement. But instead of the handsome
bearded face the secretary remembered, a woman
appeared and looked towards Pera for a moment, and
drew back hastily as she caught sight of the skiff; she
was rather a stout woman with red cheeks, and she wore
the Greek head-dress of the upper classes. So much
Omobono saw at a glance, though the window was fully
ninety feet above him, and she had only remained in sight
a few seconds. He had always had good eyes.</p>

<p>But without seeing her at all Zoë had understood that
communication between the prisoner and the outer world
was carried on through Gorlias, and that by him a message
could be sent directly to the Emperor. She did not speak
till the boat had passed the whole length of the palace
and was turning in the direction of the Sweet Waters.</p>

<p>'That astrologer,' she said, 'do you remember him?
Why has he never come again?'</p>

<p>Omobono promised to send for him the very next day.
After that there was silence for a while, and the skiff
slipped along upstream, till the secretary spoke again,
to correct what he had last said.</p>

<p>'He had better not come to-morrow. I will tell him
to come the next morning.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span></p>

<p>'Why?' Zoë asked, in some surprise.</p>

<p>'To-morrow,' said Omobono, 'Messer Sebastian Polo
comes to dine with the master. There will be confusion
in the house.'</p>

<p>'Confusion, because one guest comes to dinner?' Zoë
spoke incredulously.</p>

<p>'I believe,' said Omobono rather timidly, 'that he will
not be the only guest.'</p>

<p>'He brings his daughter with him, then?' Zoë felt
that she changed colour under her veil.</p>

<p>'I do not know,' the secretary said smoothly; 'but
there will be several guests.'</p>

<p>Zoë turned towards him impatiently.</p>

<p>'You will have orders to keep me out of the way while
they are in the house,' she said. 'I shall receive through
you the master's commands not to show myself at my
window!'</p>

<p>'How can you think such a thing?' cried Omobono,
protesting. 'Rather than put you to such inconvenience
I am sure the master will beg his guests to enter by the
other side of the house.</p>

<p>If it was his object to exasperate her, he had succeeded,
but if he expected her to break out in anger he was mistaken.
She was too proud, and she already regretted the
few hasty words she had spoken. Moreover, her anger
told her something that surprised her, and wounded her
self-respect. She understood for the first time how
jealous she was, and that she could feel no such jealousy
if she were not in love. She was not a child, and but for
misfortune she would have been married at least two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
years by this time. This was not the dreamy and slowly
stealing dawn of girlhood's day; her sun had risen in a
flash amidst angry clouds, as he does in India in mid-June,
when the south-west monsoon is just going to break and
the rain is very near.</p>

<p>When Omobono had spoken she leaned back in her
seat and drew the folds of her mantle more closely round
her, as if to separate herself from him more completely,
and she did not speak again for a long time. On his side,
the secretary understood, and instead of feeling rebuked
by her silence, he was pleased with himself because his
curiosity had made another step forward in the land of
discovery.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that it would be very interesting to
bring Zoë and Giustina within sight of each other, if no
nearer. Zeno had not said that his guests were to come
by land instead of by water; the secretary had only
argued that he would request them to do so, to avoid their
seeing Zoë if she happened to be at her window. Omobono
had power to do whatever he thought necessary for
keeping the house and the approach to it in repair without
consulting any one. That was a part of his duty.</p>

<p>It was usual to repair the road in the spring. Omobono
chose to have the work done now, sent for a gang
of labourers, and gave a few simple orders. Before Zeno
knew what was going on the way to the main entrance
was quite impassable, though a narrow passage had been
left to the door of the kitchen for the servants and slaves.
The secretary had suddenly discovered that the road
was in such a deplorable condition as to make it necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
to dig it out to the depth of a yard here and there, where
the soil was soft, thus making a series of pits, over which
no horse could pass.</p>

<p>'What in the world possessed you to do this now?'
asked Zeno, with annoyance, 'I told you that Messer
Sebastian and his daughter were coming to dine with me
to-morrow, as well as other friends.'</p>

<p>'They will see nothing, sir,' answered the secretary
imperturbably. 'The guests always come by water,
they dine on that side of the house, and they go away by
water. How could they see the road, sir? It is beyond
the court!'</p>

<p>Zeno did not choose to explain that he had especially
begged Polo and the others to come by land, and he now
concealed his displeasure, or believed that he did. But
when Omobono had gone to his own room Zeno sent for
the running footmen and bade them go to each of the
invited guests early the next morning to say that the
road was torn up and that they must be good enough to
come in their boats.</p>

<p>Then he went upstairs, for he had not seen Zoë all
day, and it pleased him to sup with her. As soon as he
entered the room and saw her he felt that something
was wrong, but he made as if he noticed nothing, and sat
down in his usual place.</p>

<p>'We will have supper together,' he said in a cheerful
tone, settling himself in his big chair, and rubbing his
hands, like a man who has finished his day's work and
looks forward to something pleasant.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he had done nothing in particular,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
and had set himself a rather disagreeable task; for he
did not wish Messer Sebastian to know that Zoë or any
other woman was in the house, and he was reduced to the
necessity of telling the girl not to show herself. She was
legally his chattel, and if he chose he might lock her up
in a room on the other side of the house for a few hours, or
in the cellar. He told himself this; and for the hundredth
time he recalled her own story of her birth and bringing
up, which was logical and clear, and explained both her
gentle breeding and the careful education she had
evidently received. But logic is often least convincing
when it is most unanswerable, and Zeno remained in the
belief that the most important part of Zoë's story was
still a secret.</p>

<p>She said nothing now in answer to his announcement,
but she beckoned to Yulia to bring supper, and the maid
disappeared. Being out of temper with him at that
moment, she was asking herself how she could possibly
be jealous of Giustina Polo; she mentally added that
she would no more think of sitting at the window to see
her go by, than of looking at her through a keyhole.
Also, she wished Zeno would sit where he was for an
hour or two, and not utter a word, so that she might show
him how utterly indifferent she was to his presence, and
that she could be just as silent as he; and women much
older than Zoë have felt just as she did then.</p>

<p>But Zeno, who was uncomfortable, was also resolved
to be cheerful and at his ease.</p>

<p>'It has been a beautiful day,' he observed. 'I hope
you had a pleasant morning on the water.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span></p>

<p>'Thanks,' Zoë answered, and said no more.</p>

<p>This was not encouraging, but Zeno was not easily
put off.</p>

<p>After a few moments he tried again.</p>

<p>'I fear you do not find my secretary very amusing,' he
said.</p>

<p>Zoë was on the point of asking him whether he himself
considered Omobono a diverting person, but she
checked herself with a little snort of indignation which
might have passed for a laugh without a smile. Zeno
glanced at her profile, raised his eyebrows, and said
nothing more till the slave-girls came with the supper.
While they brought the small table and set it between the
two, he leaned back in his carved chair, crossed one
shapely leg over the other, and drummed a noiseless tattoo
with the end of his fingers on his knee, the picture of
unconcern. Zoë half sat and half lay on her divan,
apparently scrutinising the nail of one little finger,
pushing it and rubbing it gently with the thumb of the
same hand, and then looking at it again as if she
expected to observe a change in its appearance after
being touched.</p>

<p>The maids placed the dishes on the table and poured
out wine, and Zoë began to eat in silence, without paying
any attention to Zeno. That is one way of showing
indifference, and both men and women use it, yet it still
remains surprisingly effective.</p>

<p>'What is the matter with you?' Zeno asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>Zoë pretended to be surprised and then smiled
coldly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! you mean, because I am hungry, I suppose. I
have been in the open air. It must be that.'</p>

<p>She at once took another mouthful, and went on eating.</p>

<p>'No,' answered Zeno, watching her. 'I did not mean
that.'</p>

<p>She raised her beautiful eyebrows, just as he had raised
his a few minutes earlier, but she said nothing and
seemed very busy with the fish. Carlo took another
piece, swallowed some of it deliberately, and drank a
little before he leaned back in his chair and spoke again.</p>

<p>'Something has happened,' he said at last with great
conviction.</p>

<p>'Really?' Zoë pretended surprised interest. 'What?'
she asked with affected eagerness.</p>

<p>'You understand me perfectly,' he replied with a
shade of sternness, for he was growing tired of her mood.</p>

<p>She glanced at him sideways, as a woman does when she
hears a man's tone change suddenly, and she is not sure
what he may do or say next.</p>

<p>'You do not make it easy to understand you, my lord,'
she said after an instant's hesitation.</p>

<p>'The matter is simple enough. I find you in a bad
humour&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh no! I assure you!' Zoë broke in, with a woman's
diabolical facility in interrupting a man just at the right
moment for her own advantage. 'I was never in a better
temper in my life!'</p>

<p>To prove this, she took a bird and some salad, and
smiled sweetly at her plate, leaving him to prove his
assertion, but he did not fall into the trap.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>'Then you are not easy to live with,' he observed
bluntly. 'I am glad it is over.'</p>

<p>'Do take some of this salad!' suggested Zoë. 'It is
really delicious!'</p>

<p>'To-morrow,' Zeno said, without paying any attention
to her recommendation, 'I shall have a few guests at
dinner.'</p>

<p>'I should advise you to give them a salad exactly like
this,' answered Zoë. 'It could not be better!'</p>

<p>'I am glad you like it. I leave the fare to Omobono.
It is about another matter that I have to speak.'</p>

<p>'You need not!' Zoë laughed carelessly. 'I know
what you are going to say. Shall I save you the trouble?'</p>

<p>'I do not see how you can guess what it is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Oh, easily! You do not wish your friends to see me
and you are going to order me not to look out of the
window when they come. Is that it?'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;more or less&mdash;&mdash;' Zeno was surprised.</p>

<p>'Yes, that is it,' laughed Zoë. 'But it is quite useless,
sir. I shall most certainly look out of the window, unless
you lock me up in another room; and as for your
doing that, I will yield only to force!'</p>

<p>She laughed again, much amused at the dilemma
in which she was placing him. And indeed, he did not
at first know how to answer her declaration of independence.</p>

<p>'I cannot imagine why you should be so anxious to
show yourself to people you do not know,' he said. 'Or
perhaps you fancy they may be friends&mdash;you think
that if they recognise you&mdash;but that is absurd. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
told you that if you have friends in the world you may
go to them, and you say you have none.'</p>

<p>Zoë's tone changed again and became girlishly petulant.</p>

<p>'It is nothing but curiosity, of course!' she answered.
'I want to see the people you like. Is that so unnatural?
In a whole month I have never seen one of your friends&mdash;'</p>

<p>'I have not many. But such as I have, I value, and
I do not care to let them get a mistaken impression of
me, or of the way I live.'</p>

<p>'Especially not the women amongst them,' Zoë added,
half interrogatively.</p>

<p>'There are none,' said Zeno, as if to cut short the suggestion.</p>

<p>'I see. You do not want your men friends to know
that there are women living in your house, do you?
They are doubtless all grave and elderly persons, who
would be much shocked and grieved to learn that you
have bought a pretty Greek slave. After all, you came
near being a priest, did you not? They naturally associate
you in their minds with the clergy, and for some
reason or other you think it just as well for you, or your
affairs, that they should! I have always heard that the
Venetians are good men of business!'</p>

<p>'You are probably the only person alive who would
risk saying that to me,' said Zeno, looking at her.</p>

<p>'What do I risk, my lord?' asked Zoë, with a sort of
submissive gravity.</p>

<p>'My anger,' Zeno answered curtly.</p>

<p>'Yes sir, I understand. Your anger&mdash;but pray,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
my lord, how will it show itself? Shall I be beaten, or
put in chains and starved, or turned out of your house
and sold at auction? Those are the usual punishments
for disobedient slaves, are they not?'</p>

<p>'I am not a Greek,' said Zeno, annoyed.</p>

<p>'If you were,' answered Zoë, turning her face from
him to hide her smile, 'you would probably wish to tear
out my tongue!'</p>

<p>'Perhaps.'</p>

<p>'It might be a wise precaution!' she laughed.</p>

<p>Zeno looked at her sharply now, for the words sounded
like a threat that was only half-playful. She knew
enough to compass his destruction at the hands of
Andronicus if she betrayed him, but he did not believe
she would do that, and he wondered what she was driving
at, for his experience of women's ways was small.</p>

<p>'Listen,' he said, dropping his voice a little. 'I shall
not beat you, I shall not starve you, and I shall not sell
you. But if you try to betray me, I will kill you.'</p>

<p>She raised her head proudly and met his eyes without
fear.</p>

<p>'I would spare you the trouble&mdash;if I ever betrayed
you or any one.'</p>

<p>'It is one thing to talk of death, it is another to die!'
Zeno laughed rather incredulously, as he quoted the
old Italian proverb.</p>

<p>'I have seen death,' Zoë answered, in a different tone.
'I know what it is.'</p>

<p>He wondered what she meant, but he knew it was useless
to question her, and for a few moments there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
silence. The lamps burned steadily in the quiet air,
for the evenings were still and cool, and the windows
were shut and curtained; through the curtains and the
shutters the song of a passing waterman was heard in
the stillness, a long-drawn, plaintive melody in the
Lydian Mode, familiar to Zoë's ears since she had been
a child.</p>

<p>But Zeno saw how intensely she listened to the words.
She clasped her hands tightly over her knee, and bent
forwards to catch each note and syllable.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>The waters are blue as the eyes of the Emperor's daughter,</p>
<p>In the crystal pools of her eyes there are salt tears.</p>
<p>The water is both salt and fresh.</p>
<p>Over the water to my love, this night, over the water&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>The voice died away, and Zoë no longer heard the
words distinctly; presently she could not hear the voice
at all, yet she strained her ears for a few seconds longer.
The boat must have passed, on its way down to the
Bosphorus.</p>

<p>For a whole month she had sat in the same room at
that hour, and many times already she had heard men
singing in their boats, sometimes to that same ancient
Lydian Mode, but never once had they pronounced those
meaning words. Often and often again she had passed
within sight of the Amena tower, but not until to-day
had she seen a solitary fisherman sitting at the pier's
edge below it, and he had waved his rod thrice over
the water when she passed by. And now in a flash
of intuition she guessed that the singer was the fisherman
and none other, and that the song was for her, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
for no one else; and it was a signal which she could understand
and should answer if she could; and there was but
one way of answering, and that was to show some light.</p>

<p>'It is hot,' she said, beckoning to Yulia. 'Open the
large window wide for a few minutes and let in the fresh
air.'</p>

<p>Yulia obeyed quickly. The night was very dark.</p>

<p>'Besides,' Zoë continued carelessly, as Zeno looked at
her, 'that fellow has a fine voice, and we shall still hear
him.'</p>

<p>And indeed, as the window was opened, the song was
heard again, at some distance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Over the water to my love, she is awake to-night, I see her eyes amongst the stars.</p>
<p>Love, I am here in the dark, but to-morrow I shall see the day in your face,</p>
<p>I shall see the noon in your eyes, I shall look upon the sun in your hair.</p>
<p>Over the water, the blue water, the water both salt and fresh&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>Once more the voice died away and the faint plash of
oars told Zoë that the message was all delivered, and that
Gorlias was gone, on his way downstream.</p>

<p>Zeno, whose maternal tongue was not Greek, could not
be supposed to understand much of the song, for unfamiliar
words sung to such ancient melodies can only be
caught by native-born ears, and sharp ones at that.
At a signal from Zoë, the maid shut the window again,
and drew the curtains.</p>

<p>'Could you understand the fellow?' Zeno asked, glad
in reality that the conversation had been interrupted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes,' Zoë answered lightly, 'as you would understand
an Italian fisherman, I suppose. The man gave you a
message, my lord. Shall I interpret what he said?'</p>

<p>'Can you?' He laughed a little.</p>

<p>'He tells you that if you will not try to force Arethusa
to keep away from the window to-morrow, she will
probably do as you wish&mdash;probably!'</p>

<p>'Your friend must have good ears!' Zeno smiled.
'But then he only said "probably." That is not a
promise.'</p>

<p>'Why should you trust the promise of a poor slave,
sir? You would not believe a lady of Constantinople
in the same case if she took oath on the four Gospels!
Imagine any woman missing a chance of looking at
another about whom she is curious!'</p>

<p>'Who is the other?' asked Zeno, not much pleased.</p>

<p>'She is young, and as fresh as spring. Her hair is
like that of all the Venetian ladies&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Since you have seen her, why are you so anxious to
see her again?'</p>

<p>'Ah! You see! It is she! I knew it! She is
coming to-morrow with her father.'</p>

<p>'Well? If she is, what of it?' asked Zeno, impatiently.</p>

<p>'Nothing. Since you admit that it is she, I do not
care to see her at all. I will be good and you need not
lock me up.'</p>

<p>Thereupon she bent towards the table and began to
eat again, daintily, but as if she were still hungry. Zeno
watched her in silence for some time, conscious that of
all women he had ever seen none had so easily touched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
him, none had played upon his moods as she did, making
him impatient, uneasy, angry, and forgiving by turns,
within a quarter of an hour. A few minutes ago he had
been so exasperated that he had rudely longed to box
her little ears; and now he felt much more inclined to
kiss her, and did not care to think how very easy and
wholly lawful it was for him to do so. That was one of
his many dilemmas; if he spoke to her as his equal she
told him she was a slave, but when he treated her ever
so little as if she were one, her proud little head went
up, and she looked like an empress.</p>

<p>She had never been so much like one as to-night, he
thought, though there was nothing very imperial in
the action of eating a very sticky strawberry, drawn up
out of thick syrup with a forked silver pin. She did it
with grace, no doubt, twisting the pin dexterously, so
that the big drop of syrup spread all round the berry
just at the right moment, and it never dripped. Zeno
had often seen the wife of the Emperor Charles eating
stewed prunes with her fingers, which was not neat or
pleasant to see, though it might be imperial, since she was
a genuine empress. But it was neither Zoë's grace nor
her delicate ways that pleased him and puzzled him
most; the mystery lay rather in the fearless tone of
her voice and the proud carriage of her head when she
was offended, in the flashing answer of her brave eyes
and the noble curve of her tender mouth; for these are
things given, not learnt, and if they could be taught at
all, thought Zeno, they would not be taught to a slave.</p>

<p>He let his head rest against the back of his chair and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
wished many things, rather incoherently. For once in
his life he felt inclined for anything rather than action or
danger, or any sudden change; and in the detestable
natural contradiction of duty and inclination it chanced
that on that night, of all nights, he could not stay
where he was to idle away two or three hours in careless
talk, till it should be time to go downstairs and sleep.
The habit of spending his evenings in that way had
grown upon him during the past month more than he
realised; but to-night he knew that he must break
through it, and perhaps to-morrow, too, and for long
afterwards, if not for ever. That was one reason why
it had annoyed him to find Zoë out of temper.</p>

<p>He rose with an effort, and with something like a
sigh.</p>

<p>'I must be going,' he said, standing beside the divan.
'Good-night.'</p>

<p>Zoë had looked up in surprise when he left his seat,
and now her face fell.</p>

<p>'Already? Must you go already?' she asked.</p>

<p>'Yes. I have to keep an appointment. Good-night.'</p>

<p>'Good-night, Messer Carlo,' answered Zoë softly and
a little sadly.</p>

<p>She had never before addressed him in that way, as
an equal and a Venetian would have done, and the expression,
with the tone in which it was uttered, arrested
his attention and stopped him when he was in the act
of turning away. He said nothing, but there was a
question in his look.</p>

<p>'I am sorry that I made you angry,' she said, and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
turned her face up to him with one of those half-pathetic,
hesitating little smiles that ask forgiveness of a man
and invariably get it, unless he is a brute.</p>

<p>'I am sorry that I let you see I was annoyed,' he answered
simply.</p>

<p>'If I had not been so foolish, you would not go away
so early!'</p>

<p>Her tone was contrite and regretfully thoughtful, as
if the explanation were irrefutable but humiliating.
Eve was, on the whole, a good woman, and is believed
to be in Paradise; yet with the slight previous training
of a few minutes' conversation with the serpent she was
an accomplished temptress, and her rustic taste for
apples has sent untold millions down into unquenchable
fire. It was a mere coincidence that Eve should have
been always called Zoë in the early Greek translations of
Genesis, and that Zoë Rhangabé should have inherited
a dangerous resemblance to the first beautiful&mdash;and
enterprising&mdash;mother of men.</p>

<p>'I would stay if I could,' Zeno said. 'But indeed I
have an appointment, and I must go.'</p>

<p>'Is it very important, very&mdash;very?'</p>

<p>Zeno smiled at her now, but did not answer at once.
Instead, he walked to the window, opened the shutters
again, and looked out. The night was very dark. Here
and there little lights twinkled in the houses of Pera,
and those that were near the water's edge made tiny
paths over the black stream. After his eyes had grown
used to the gloom Zeno could make out that there was
a boat near the marble steps, and a very soft sound of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
oars moving in the water told him that the boatman
was paddling gently to keep his position against the slow
current. Zeno shut the window again and turned back
to Zoë.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, answering her last speech after the
interval, 'it is very important. If it were not, I would
not go out to-night.'</p>

<p>He was going out of the house, then. She knew that
he rarely did so after dark, and she could not help connecting
his going with the invitation he had given to
Polo and his daughter for the next day. Zoë's imagination
instantly spun a thread across the chasms of improbability,
and ran along the fairy bridge to the regions
of the impossible beyond. He was to be betrothed to
Giustina to-morrow, he was going now to settle some
urgent matter of business connected with the marriage-contract;
or he was betrothed already; yes, and he was
to be married in the morning and would bring his bride
home; Zoë, in her lonely room upstairs, would hear the
noisy feasting of the wedding-guests below&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>When the thread broke, leaving her in the unreality,
her lip quivered, and she was a little pale. Zeno was
standing beside her, holding her hand.</p>

<p>'Good-night, Arethusa,' he said in a tone that frightened
her.</p>

<p>The words sounded like 'good-bye,' for that was what
they might mean; he knew it, and she guessed it.</p>

<p>'You are going away!' she cried, springing to her
feet and slipping her hand from his to catch his
wrist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>'Not if I can help it,' he answered. 'But you may
not see me to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Not in the evening?' she asked in great anxiety.
'Not even after they are gone?'</p>

<p>'I cannot tell,' he replied gravely. 'Perhaps
not.'</p>

<p>She dropped his wrist and turned from him.</p>

<p>'You are going to be married,' she said in a low voice.
'I was sure of it.'</p>

<p>'No!' he answered with emphasis. 'Not that!'</p>

<p>She turned to him again; it did not occur to her to
doubt his word, and her eyes asked him the next question
with eager anxiety, but he would not answer. He
only repeated the three words, very tenderly and softly&mdash;</p>

<p>'Good-night&mdash;Arethusa!'</p>

<p>She knew it was good-bye, though he would not say
it; she was not guessing his meaning now. But she
was proud. He should not see how hurt she was.</p>

<p>'Good-night,' she answered. 'If you are going away&mdash;then,
good-bye.'</p>

<p>Her voice almost broke, but she pressed her lips
tight together when the last word had passed them, and
though the tears seemed to be burning her brain she
would not shed them while his eyes were on her.</p>

<p>'God keep you,' he said, as one says who goes on a
long journey.</p>

<p>Again he was turning from her, not meaning to look
back; but it was more than she could bear. In an inward
tempest of fear and pain she had been taught
suddenly that she truly loved him more than her soul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
and in the same instant he was leaving her for a long time,
perhaps for ever. She could not bear it, and her pride
broke down. She caught his hand as he turned to go
and held it fast.</p>

<p>'Take me with you!' she cried. 'Oh, do not go away
and leave me behind!'</p>

<p>A silence of three seconds.</p>

<p>'I will come back,' he said. 'If I am alive, I will
come back.'</p>

<p>'You are going into danger!' Her hand tightened on
his, and she grew paler still.</p>

<p>He would not answer, but he patted her wrist kindly,
trying to soothe her anxiety. He seemed quiet enough
at that moment, but he felt the slow, full beat of his own
heart and the rush of the swelling pulse in his throat.
He had not guessed before to-night that she loved him;
he was too simple, and far too sure that he himself could
not love a slave. Even now he did not like to own it,
but he knew that the hand she held was not passive;
it pressed hers tighter in return, and drew it to him
instead of pushing it away, till at last it was close to his
breast.</p>

<p>'Oh, let me go with you, take me with you!' she repeated,
beseeching with all her heart.</p>

<p>He was not thinking of danger now, he had forgotten
it so far that he scarcely paid attention to her words or
to her passionate entreaty. Words had lost sense and
value, as they do in battle, and the fire ran along his
arm to her hand. It had been cold; it was hot now,
and throbbed strangely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>Then he dropped it and took her suddenly by her
small throat, almost violently, and turned her face up
to his; but she was not frightened, and she smiled in
his grasp.</p>

<p>'I did not mean to love you!'</p>

<p>He still held her as he spoke; she put up her hands
together and took his wrists, but not to free herself;
instead, she pressed his hold closer upon her throat,
as if to make him choke her.</p>

<p>'I wish you would kill me now!' she cried, in a trembling,
happy little voice.</p>

<p>He laughed low, and shook her the least bit, as a
strong man shakes a child in play, but her eyes drew him
to her more and more.</p>

<p>'It would be so easy now,' she almost whispered,
'and I should be so happy!'</p>

<p>Then they kissed; and as their lips touched they
closed their eyes, for they were too near to see each other
any longer. Her head sank back from his upon his arm,
for she was almost fainting, and he laid his palm gently
on her forehead and pushed away her hair, and looked
at her long.</p>

<p>'I had not meant to love you,' he said again.</p>

<p>Her lips were still parted, tender as rose-leaves at
dewfall, and her eyes glistened as she opened them at
the sound of his voice.</p>

<p>'Are you sorry?' she asked faintly.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_221" id="i_221"></a>
<img src="images/i_221.jpg" width="401" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">'I did not mean to love you!'</p>
</div>

<p>He kissed the question from her lips, and her right
hand went up to his brown throat and round it, and
drew him, to press the kiss closer; and then it held him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
down while she moved her head till she could whisper
in his ear:&mdash;</p>

<p>'It was only because you were angry,' she said. 'You
are not really going out to-night! Tell me you are not!'</p>

<p>He would not answer at first, and he tried to kiss her
again, but she would not let him, and she pushed him
away till she could see his face. He met her eyes frankly,
but he shook his head.</p>

<p>'It must be to-night, and no other night,' he said
gravely. 'I have made an appointment, and I have
given my word. I cannot break it, but I shall come
back.'</p>

<p>She slipped from his hold, and sat down on the broad
divan, against the cushions.</p>

<p>'You are going into danger,' she said. 'You may
not come back. You told me so.'</p>

<p>He tried to laugh, and answered in a careless tone:&mdash;</p>

<p>'I have come back from far more dangerous expeditions.
Besides, I have guests to-morrow&mdash;that is a
good reason for not being killed!'</p>

<p>He stood beside her, one hand half-thrust into his
loose belt. She took the other, which hung down, and
looked up to him, still pleading.</p>

<p>'Please, please do not go to-night!'</p>

<p>Still he shook his head; nothing could move him, and
he would go. A piteous look came into her eyes while
they appealed to his in vain, and suddenly she dropped
his hand and buried her face in the soft leathern pillow.</p>

<p>'You had made me forget that I am only a slave!'
she cried.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span></p>

<p>The cushion muffled her voice, and the sentence was
broken by a sob, though no tears came with it.</p>

<p>'I would go to-night, though my own mother begged
me to stay,' Zeno answered.</p>

<p>Zoë turned her head without lifting it, and looked up
at him sideways.</p>

<p>'Then much depends on your going,' she said, with a
question in her tone. 'If it were only for yourself, for
your pleasure, or your fortune, you would not refuse
your own mother!'</p>

<p>Zeno turned and began to walk up and down the
room, but he said nothing in reply. A thought began
to dawn in her mind.</p>

<p>'But if it were for your country&mdash;for Venice&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>He glanced sharply at her as he turned back towards
her in his walk, and he slackened his pace. Zoë waited
a moment before she spoke again, looked down, thoughtfully
pinched the folds of silk on her knee, and looked up
suddenly again as if an idea had struck her.</p>

<p>'And though I am only your bought slave,' she said,
'I would not hinder you then. I mean, I would not even
try to keep you from running into danger&mdash;for Venice!'</p>

<p>She held her head up proudly now, and the last words
rang out in a tone that went to the man's heart. He
was not far from her when she spoke them. The last
syllable had not died away on the quiet air and he already
held her up in his arms, lifted clear from the floor,
and his kisses were raining on her lips, and on her eyes,
and her hair. She laughed low at the storm she had
raised.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>'I love you!' he whispered again and again softly,
roughly, and triumphantly by turns.</p>

<p>She loved him too, and quite as passionately just then;
every kiss woke a deep and delicious thrill that made
her whole body quiver with delight, and each oft-repeated
syllable of the three whispered words rang like
a silver trumpet-note in her heart. But for all that her
thoughts raced on, already following him in the coming
hours.</p>

<p>With every woman, to love a man is to feel that she
must positively know just where he is going as soon as
he is out of her sight. If it were possible, he should never
leave the house without a ticket-of-leave and a policeman,
followed by a detective to watch both; but that a
man should assert any corresponding right to watch the
dear object of his affections throws her into a paroxysm
of fury; and it is hard to decide which woman most
resents being spied upon, the angel of light, the siren
that walketh in darkness, or the semi-virginal
flirt.</p>

<p>Zoë really loved Zeno more truly at that moment,
because the glorious tempest of kisses her speech had
called down upon her willing little head brought with it
the certainty that he was not going to spend the rest of
the evening at the house of Sebastian Polo. This, at
least, is how it strikes the story-teller in the bazaar;
but the truth is that no man ever really understood any
woman. It is uncertain whether any one woman understands
any other woman; it is doubtful whether any
woman understands her own nature; but one thing is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
sure, beyond question&mdash;every woman who loves a man
believes, or tells him, that he helps her to understand
herself. This shows us that men are not altogether
useless.</p>

<p>Yet, to do Zoë justice, there was one other element
in her joy. She had waited long to learn that Zeno
meant to free Johannes if it could be done, and he had
met all her questions with answers that told her nothing;
she was convinced that he did not even know the passwords
of those who called themselves conspirators,
but who had done nothing in two years beyond inventing
a few signs and syllables by which to recognise each other.
Whether he knew them or not, he was ready to act at
last, and the deed on which hung the destinies of Constantinople
was to be attempted that very night. Before
dawn Michael Rhangabé's death might be avenged, and
Kyría Agatha's wrongs with Zoë's own.</p>

<p>'I want to help you,' she said, when he let her speak.
'Tell me how you are going to do it.'</p>

<p>'With a boat and a rope,' he answered.</p>

<p>'Take me! I will sit quite still in the bottom. I
will watch; no one has better eyes or ears than I.'</p>

<p>'More beautiful you mean!'</p>

<p>He shut her eyes with his lips and kissed the lobe of
one little ear. But she moved impatiently in his arms,
with a small laugh that meant many things&mdash;that she
was happy, and that she loved him, but that a kiss was
no answer to what she had just said, and that he must not
kiss her again till he had replied in words.</p>

<p>'Take me!' she repeated.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>'This is man's work,' he answered. 'Besides, it is
the work of one man only, and no more.'</p>

<p>'Some one must watch below,' Zoë suggested.</p>

<p>'There is the man in the boat. But watching is useless.
If any one surprises us in the tower, I can get
away; but if I am caught by an enemy from the water
the game is up. That is the only danger.'</p>

<p>'That is the only danger,' Zoë repeated, more to herself
than for him.</p>

<p>He saw that she had understood now, and that she
would not try to keep him longer, nor again beg to be
taken. She went with him to the door of the vestibule
without calling the maids, and she parted from him there,
very quietly.</p>

<p>'God speed you!' she said, for good-bye.</p>

<p>When he reached the outer entrance and looked back
once more, she was already gone within, and the quiet
lamplight fell across the folds of the heavy curtain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p>Zeno left his house noiselessly half an hour later, after
changing his clothes. He was now lightly clad in dark
hose and a soft deerskin doublet with tight sleeves,
a close-fitting woollen skull-cap covered his head, and
he had no weapon but one good knife of which the sheath
was fastened to the back of his belt, as a sailor carries
it when he goes aloft to work on rigging. The night was
cool, and he had a wide cloak over his shoulders, ready
to drop in an instant if necessary.</p>

<p>It was intensely dark as he came out, and after being
in the light he could hardly see the white marble steps
of the landing. He almost lost his balance at the last
one, and when he stepped quickly towards the boat, to
save himself, he could not see it at all, and was considerably
relieved to find himself in the stern sheets instead
of in the water.</p>

<p>'Gorlias!' he whispered, leaning forwards.</p>

<p>'Yes!' answered the astrologer-fisherman.</p>

<p>The light skiff shot out into the darkness, away from
the shore, instead of heading directly for Blachernæ.
After a few minutes Gorlias rested on his oars. Zeno had
grown used to the gloom and could now see him quite
distinctly. Both men peered about them and listened
for the sound of other oars, but there was nothing;
they were alone on the water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<p>'Is everything ready?' Zeno asked in a low tone.</p>

<p>'Everything. At the signal over eight hundred men
will be before Blachernæ in a few minutes. There are
fifty ladders in the ruined houses by the wall of the city.
The money has had an excellent effect on the guard,
for most of them were drunk this evening, and are asleep
now. In the tower, the captain is asleep too, for his
wife showed the red light an hour ago. She took up
the package of opium last night by the thread.'</p>

<p>'And Johannes himself? Is he ready?'</p>

<p>'He is timid, but he will risk his life to get out of the
tower. You may be sure of that!'</p>

<p>'Have you everything we need? The fishing-line,
the tail-block, and the two ropes? And the basket?
Is everything ready in the bows, there?'</p>

<p>'Everything, just as you ordered it, and the rope clear
to pay out.'</p>

<p>'Give way, then.'</p>

<p>'In the name of God,' said Gorlias, as he dipped his
oars again.</p>

<p>'Amen,' answered Zeno quietly.</p>

<p>The oars were muffled with rags at the thole-pins,
and Gorlias was an accomplished oarsman. He dipped
the blades into the stream so gently that there was hardly
a ripple, and he pulled them through with long, steady
strokes, keeping the boat on its course by the scattered
lights of the city.</p>

<p>Zeno watched the lights, too, leaning back in the stern,
and turning over the last details of his plan. Everything
depended on getting the imprisoned man out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
the Amena tower at once, and he believed he could do
that without much difficulty. At first sight it might
seem madness to attempt a revolution with only eight
hundred men to bear arms in the cause, against ten or
fifteen thousand, but the Venetian knew what sort of
men they were, and how profoundly Andronicus was
hated by all the army except his body-guard. The
latter would fight, no doubt, and perhaps die to a man,
for they had everything to lose, and expected no quarter;
but for the next two hours most of them would be
still helplessly asleep after their potations, and if they
woke at all they would hardly be in a condition to defend
themselves. Money had been distributed to them
without knowledge of their officers, purporting to be
sent to them from Sultan Amurad, now in Asia Minor.
It had pleased the Turk more than once to keep the guards
in a good humour towards him, and the soldiers were not
surprised. Besides, they cared very little whence money
came, provided it got into their hands, and could
be spent in drink, for they were not sober Greeks or
Italians; most of them were wild barbarians, who would
rather drink than eat, and rather fight than drink, as
the saying goes.</p>

<p>For nearly twenty minutes Gorlias pulled steadily
upstream. Then he slackened speed, and brought the
boat slowly to the foot of the tower.</p>

<p>The windows were all dark now, and the great mass
towered up into the night till the top was lost in the
black sky. During the hours Gorlias had spent in fishing
from the pier he had succeeded in wedging a stout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
oak peg between the stones; he found it at once in the
dark, got out and made the boat fast to it by the painter.
His bare feet clung to the sloping surface like a fly's
to a smooth wall; he pulled the boat alongside the pier,
holding it by the gunwale, and held up his other hand to
help Zeno. But the Venetian was in no need of that,
and was standing beside his companion in an instant.
It was only then, a whole second after the fact, that he
knew he had stepped upon something oddly soft and at
the same time elastic and resisting, that lay amidships
in the bottom of the boat, covered with canvas. The
quick recollection was that of having unconsciously
placed one foot on a human body when getting out. He
had taken off his shoes, but the cloth soles of his hose
were thick, and he could not feel sure of what he had
touched. Besides, he had no time to lose in speculating
as to what Gorlias might have in the skiff besides his
lines and his coil of rope.</p>

<p>Gorlias now got the end of the fishing-line ashore,
and took it in his teeth in order to climb up the inclined
plane of the pier on his hands and feet, ape-fashion. In
a few seconds he had found the end of a string that hung
down from the blackness above, with a small stone tied
to it to keep it from being blown adrift. To this string
he bent the fishing-line. Until this was done neither
of the men had made the least sound that could possibly
be heard above, but now Gorlias gave a signal. It was
the cry of the beautiful little owl that haunts ruined
houses in Italy and the East, one soft and musical note,
repeated at short and regular intervals. The bird
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
always gives it thus, but for the signal Gorlias whistled
it twice each time, instead of once. No living owl
ever did that, and yet it was a thousand to one that
nobody would notice the difference, if any one heard
him at all, except the person for whom the call was
meant.</p>

<p>He had not been whistling more than a quarter of
a minute when he felt the twine passing upwards through
his fingers, and then the line after it. He let the latter
run through his hand to be sure that it did not foul and
kink, though he had purposely chosen one that had been
long in use, and he had kept it in a dry place for a week.</p>

<p>Zeno had dropped his cloak in the stern of the boat
before getting out, and he now sat at the water's edge
with his hands on the moving line ready to check the
end when it came, in case it were not already fast to
the rope that was to follow it. But Gorlias had done
that beforehand, lest any time should be lost, and presently
Zeno felt the line growing taut as it began to
pull on the rope itself.</p>

<p>This had single overhand knots in it, about two feet
apart, for climbing, and instead of coiling it down,
Gorlias had ranged it fore and aft on the forward thwarts
so that it came ashore clear. Whatever the astrologer's
original profession had been, it was evident that he understood
how to handle rope as well as if he had been to
sea. Moreover Zeno, who was as much a sailor as a
soldier, understood from the speed at which the rope
was now taken up, that there was a tolerably strong
person at the other end of it, high up in the topmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
story of the tower. The end came sooner than he expected,
and a slight noise of something catching and
knocking against the inner side of the boat brought
Gorlias instantly to the water's edge.</p>

<p>'The tail-block is fast to the end,' he whispered;
'and the other line is already rove, with the basket at
one end of it. When you are aloft, you must haul up
the climbing rope and make the block fast&mdash;you understand.'</p>

<p>'Of course,' Zeno answered, 'I have been to sea.'</p>

<p>'Whistle when you are ready and I will answer. As
he comes down I can check the rope with a turn round
a smooth stone I have found at the corner of the tower.
You must come down the climbing rope at the same time,
and steer the basket as well as you can with your foot.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Is all fast above?'</p>

<p>Gorlias listened.</p>

<p>'Not yet,' he whispered. 'Wait for the signal.'</p>

<p>It came presently, the cry of the owlet repeated, as
Gorlias had repeated it. Zeno heard it and began to
climb, while Gorlias steadied the rope, though there was
hardly any need for that. The young Venetian walked
up with his feet to the wall, taking the rope hand over
hand, as if he were going up a bare pole by a gant-line.</p>

<p>When he was twenty feet above the pier and was fast
disappearing in the darkness, something moved in the
boat, and a white face looked up cautiously over the gunwale.
It was a woman's face. Zeno had stepped upon
her with his whole weight when he was getting ashore,
but she had made no sound. Her eyes tried to pierce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
the gloom, to follow him upwards in his dizzy ascent.
Soon she could not see him any longer, nor hear the soft
sound of his cloth-shod feet as he planted them against
the stones.</p>

<p>Up he went, higher and higher. Gorlias steadied
the end below, keeping one foot on the block lest it
should thrash about on the stones and make a noise.
He could feel each of Zeno's movements along the rope;
and though he had seen many feats in his life, he wondered
at the wind and endurance of a man who could
make such an ascent without once crooking his leg
round the rope to rest and take breath. But Carlo Zeno
never stopped till his feet were on the slight projecting
moulding of the highest story, and his hands on the stone
sill.</p>

<p>As he drew himself up with a spring his face almost
struck the chest of a large woman who was standing at
the window to receive him. He saw her outline faintly,
for there was a little light from one small lamp, placed on
the floor in the farthest corner of the oblong room. The
tower was square, but the north side of the chamber was
walled off to make a space for the head of the staircase
and a narrow entry. The single door was in this partition.
Zeno looked round while he took breath, and
he was aware of a tall man with a long beard who stood
on one side of the window, and seemed inclined to flatten
himself against the wall, as if he feared being seen from
without, even at that height and in the dark.</p>

<p>The woman moved a step backwards, and Carlo put
one leg over the window-sill and got in. He took his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
skull-cap from his head and bowed low to the imprisoned
Emperor before he spoke to the woman
in a whisper.</p>

<p>'I will haul up the basket,' he said, and he laid his
hands on the knotted rope to do so.</p>

<p>But the tall man with the beard touched him on the
shoulder, and spoke in a low voice.</p>

<p>'We must talk together,' he said.</p>

<p>Zeno hardly turned his head, and did not stop hauling
in the rope. Below, Gorlias was steering the tail-block
clear of the wall, lest it should strike the stones and
make a noise.</p>

<p>'This is no time for talking,' Zeno said. 'When your
Majesty is free and in safety we can talk at leisure.'</p>

<p>The knotted rope was coming in fast; Zeno threw
it upon the floor behind him in a wide coil to keep it
clear.</p>

<p>'Stop!' commanded the Emperor, laying one hand on
the Venetian's arm.</p>

<p>Zeno set his foot on the rope to keep it from running
out, and turned to the prisoner in surprise.</p>

<p>'Every moment is precious,' he said. 'If we are discovered
from outside the tower the game is up, and we
shall be caught like rats in a trap. I have a basket at
the end of this rope in which you will be quite safe from
falling, if that is what makes you hesitate. Fear nothing.
We are two good men, I and my companion below.'</p>

<p>'You are a good man indeed, to have risked your life
in climbing here,' answered Johannes.</p>

<p>He made a few steps, bending his still handsome head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
in thought. He limped slightly in his walk, and he was
said to have only four toes on his left foot.</p>

<p>Zeno at once continued hauling up the rope, but a
moment later the Emperor stopped close beside him.</p>

<p>'It is of no use,' he said; 'I cannot go with you.'</p>

<p>Zeno was thunderstruck, and stood still with the
rope in his two hands.</p>

<p>'You will not go?' he repeated, almost stupidly.
'You will not be free, now that everything is ready?'</p>

<p>'I cannot. Go down your rope before there is an alarm.
Take God's blessing for your generous courage, and my
heartfelt thanks. I am ashamed that I should have
nothing else to offer you. I cannot go.'</p>

<p>'But why? Why?'</p>

<p>Carlo Zeno could not remember that he had ever been
so much surprised in his life, and so are they who gather
round the story-teller and listen to his tale. But it is
a true one; and many years afterwards one of Carlo
Zeno's grandsons, the good old Bishop of Belluno, wrote
it down as he had heard it from his grandsire's lips.
Moreover it is history. The imprisoned Emperor Johannes
refused to leave his prison, after Zeno had risked
life and limb to prepare a revolution, and had scaled the
tower alone.</p>

<p>'Andronicus has my little son in the palace,' said the
prisoner; 'if I escape he will put out the child's eyes
with boiling vinegar, and perhaps mutilate him or kill
him by inches. Save him first, then I will go with you.'</p>

<p>There was something very noble in the prisoner's
tone, and in the turn of his handsome head as he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
spoke. Zeno could not help respecting him, yet
he was profoundly disappointed. He tried one
argument.</p>

<p>'If you will come at once,' he said, 'I promise you
that we shall hold the palace before daybreak, and the
little prince will be as free as you.'</p>

<p>Johannes shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>'The guards will kill him instantly,' he said; 'the
more certainly if they see that they must fight for their
lives.'</p>

<p>'In short, your Majesty is resolved? You will not
come with me?'</p>

<p>'I cannot.' The Emperor turned away, and covered
his face with his hands, more as if trying to concentrate
his thoughts than as if in despair. 'No, I cannot,'
he repeated presently. 'Save the boy first,' he repeated,
dropping his hands and turning to Zeno again, 'then I
will go with you.'</p>

<p>Zeno was silent for a moment, and then spoke in a
determined tone.</p>

<p>'Hear me, sire,' he said. 'A man does not run such
risks twice, except for his own blood. You must either
come with me at once, or give up the idea that I shall
ever help you to escape. The boy may be in danger,
but so are you yourself, and your life is worth more to
this unhappy Empire than his. To-night, to-morrow,
at any moment, your son Andronicus may send the executioner
here, and there will be an end of you and of
many hopes. You must risk your younger boy's life
for your cause. I see no other way.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>'The other way is this; I will stay here and risk my
own. I would rather die ten deaths than let my child
be tortured, blinded, and murdered.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' answered Zeno; 'then I must go.'</p>

<p>He let the knotted rope go over the sill again till it
was all out, and he sat astride the window mullion ready
to begin the descent.</p>

<p>'Cast off the rope when I whistle,' he said, 'and let it
down by the line, and the line after it by the
twine.'</p>

<p>He spoke to the big woman, who was the wife of the
keeper, himself a trusted captain of veterans. She
nodded by way of answer.</p>

<p>'For the last time,' Zeno said, looking towards Johannes,
'will you come with me? There is still
time.'</p>

<p>The Emperor looked prematurely old in the faint light,
and his figure was bent as he rested with one hand on
the heavy table. His voice was weak too, as if he were
very tired after some great effort.</p>

<p>'For the last time, no,' he answered. 'I am sorry.
I thank you with all my heart&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Zeno did not wait for more, and his head disappeared
below the window almost before the prisoner had spoken
the last words. Five minutes had not elapsed since he
had reached the chamber.</p>

<p>Below, Gorlias had been surprised when he felt the
second rope slack in his hand, and when the basket and
block, which had been half-way up the wall, began to
come down again. The astrologer could only suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
that there was an alarm within the tower, and that Zeno
was getting away as fast as he could. The last written
message, lowered by the yarn at dusk that evening, had
been to say that the Emperor was ready, and that a
red light would be shown when the captain was asleep,
under the influence of the drug his wife had given him.
It could not possibly occur to the astrologer that Johannes
would change his mind at the very last
moment.</p>

<p>'Take care!' Gorlias whispered quickly to the woman
at his elbow, as soon as he was sure of what was happening.
'He is coming down again.'</p>

<p>'Alone?' The anxious inquiry answered his words
in the same breath.</p>

<p>'Alone&mdash;yes! He is on the rope now, he is coming
down, hand under hand.'</p>

<p>The woman slipped down the inclined surface, almost
fell, recovered her foothold, and nearly fell again as she
sprang into the boat, and threw herself at full length
upon the bottom boards. Zeno was half-way down,
and before she covered herself with the canvas she
glanced up and distinctly saw his dark figure descending
through the gloom.</p>

<p>She had scarcely stretched herself out when she was
startled by a loud cry, close at hand.</p>

<p>'Phylaké! Aho&mdash;ho&mdash;o! Watch, ho! Watch,
ho!'</p>

<p>A boat had shot out of the darkness to the edge of the
pier. In an instant three men had sprung ashore, and
were clambering up the sloping masonry towards Gorlias.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
The woman stood up in Zeno's skiff, almost upsetting
it, and her eyes pierced the gloom to see what was happening.</p>

<p>Gorlias threw himself desperately against the three
men, with outstretched arms, hoping to sweep them
altogether into the water from a place where they had
so little foothold. The woman held her breath. One
of the three men, active as a monkey, dodged past
the astrologer, caught the knotted rope, and began climbing
it. The other two fell, their feet entangled in the
line-rove through the tail-block, and with the strong
man's weight behind them they tumbled headlong down
the incline. With a heavy splash, and scarcely more
than one for all three, Gorlias and his opponents fell
into the water.</p>

<p>There was silence then, while the other man climbed
higher and higher.</p>

<p>The woman watched in horror. In falling, the men
had struck against the stem of the skiff, dragging the
painter from the peg. The other boat was not moored
at all, and both were now adrift on the sluggish stream.
The woman steadied herself, and tried to see.</p>

<p>The man climbed fast, and above him the dark figure
moved quickly upwards. But Zeno's pursuer was fresher
than he, and as quick as a cat, and gained on him. If
he caught him, he might crook his leg round the knotted
rope to drag Zeno down and hurl him to the
ground.</p>

<p>Still he gained, while the boats began to drift, but still
the woman could make out both figures, nearer and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
nearer to each other. Now there were not ten feet
between them.</p>

<p>A faint cry was heard, a heavy thud on the stones,
and silence again. Zeno had cut the rope below him.
The woman drew a sharp breath between her closed
teeth. There was no noise, now, for the man that had
been as active as a cat was dead.</p>

<p>But an instant later one of the other three was out of
the water, and on the edge of the pier, panting for breath.</p>

<p>The woman took up one of the oars, and tried to paddle
with it. She thought that the man who had come
up must be Gorlias, and that the other two were drowned,
and she tried to get the boat to the pier again; she had
never held an oar in her life, and she was trembling now.
High in mid-air Zeno was hanging on what was left of
the rope, slowly working his way upwards, fully fifty
feet above the base of the tower.</p>

<p>The skiff bumped against the other boat alongside,
and the woman began to despair of getting nearer to
the land, and tried to shove the empty boat away with
her hands. The effect was to push her own skiff towards
the pier, for the other was much the heavier of the two.
Then, paddling a little, she made a little way. The man
ashore seemed to be examining the body of the one who
had been killed; it lay sprawling on the stones, the head
smashed. The living one was not Gorlias; the woman
could see his outline now. She was strong, and with the
one oar shoved her skiff still farther from the other boat,
and nearer to the pier. The man heard her, got upon his
feet, and slipped down to the water's edge again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span></p>

<p>'Hold out the end of the oar to me,' he said, 'and I
will pull the boat in.'</p>

<p>It was not the voice of Gorlias that spoke, and the
woman did not obey the instructions it gave. On the
contrary she tried to paddle away, lest the man should
jump aboard. Strangely enough the skiff seemed to
answer at once to her will, as if some unseen power were
helping her. It could not be her unskilled, almost helpless
movements of the oar that guided it away.</p>

<p>But the man rose to his feet, on the lowest course
of the stones, where there was a ledge, and he sprang
forwards, struck the water without putting his head
under, and was at the stern of the boat in a few seconds.</p>

<p>The woman seemed fearless, for she stepped quickly
over the after thwart, taking her oar with her, and a
moment later she struck a desperate blow with it at the
swimmer, and raised it again. She could not see him
any more, and she knew that if she had struck his head
he must have sunk instantly; but she waited a little
longer in the stern, the oar still uplifted in both her
hands.</p>

<p>At that moment, the repeated call of the owlet came
down from far above. It could only mean that Zeno
had reached the upper window in safety. Then the boat
rocked violently two or three times, and the woman
was thrown down, sitting, in the stern sheets; she saw
that a man was getting in over the bows, and was already
on board.</p>

<p>'That was well done, Kokóna,' said the voice of Gorlias,
softly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>Zoë sank back in the stern, half-fainting with exhaustion,
pain, and past anxiety.</p>

<p>'Is he safe?' she managed to ask.</p>

<p>'That was his call. He has reached the window again,
but it was a narrow escape.'</p>

<p>She could hardly breathe. Gorlias had taken the oars,
and the skiff was moving.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p>Zeno found the two occupants of the room terrorstruck,
and standing on one side of the window, from which
they had not dared to look out after the cry of alarm had
been given from below. Indeed they were in a dangerous
pass, unless all three of the men who had attempted to
stop Zeno were dead, or if the first cry had roused the
sleeping captain and guards of the tower from their
drugged sleep.</p>

<p>But Zeno's own situation was quite as bad. It was
out of the question to shout to Gorlias, on the mere
chance of his being still alive and on the pier. No communication
was possible, and the rope was cut below.
It was true that the whole of the fishing-line still lay
coiled on the floor of the room, but even if it were long
enough to double it would hardly bear the man's weight;
and Carlo guessed that he had cut off nearly three-quarters
of the knotted rope below him.</p>

<p>There was no time to be lost either. He did not know
the number of his assailants, and though he gave his
signal when he reached the window, on the mere chance
of being heard, he would not have trusted the answer to
it if it had come. Any one could imitate such a sound
after hearing it once. If he let down the remaining
length of the rope by the fishing-line, and if his enemies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
were on the pier instead of Gorlias, they would have
wit enough to knot the rope where it had been cut, and
to send it up again, for him to come down by, and he
would drop into their very midst.</p>

<p>He understood all this in an instant, and without
hesitation he cast off everything above, and dropped
the rope and the fishing-line out of the window. He
knew Gorlias well enough to be sure that he would come
back before daylight and land if there were no one on the
pier, and remove all traces of the attempt.</p>

<p>'We are all lost!' moaned the big woman.</p>

<p>'My hour has come,' said the Emperor Johannes in
solemn terror.</p>

<p>Thereupon he began to say his prayers, and paid no
more attention to the others. Zeno took the woman
by the wrist.</p>

<p>'We are not lost unless your husband is awake,' he
said. 'Take me to him.'</p>

<p>The captain's wife stared at him.</p>

<p>'There is no other way. If he is awake, you will tell
him that I got into the tower, and that you have betrayed
me into his hands. You will be safe at least, and I will
take my chance. If he is asleep I have nothing to fear.'</p>

<p>He drew her to the door and began to unbar it himself.
She had understood that he was right, so far as her own
safety was concerned, and she helped him. A horn
lantern stood on the stone floor in the entry at the head
of the stair, where she had left it when she had last come
up. Before going down she barred the door outside as
usual, and then led the way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>At the first landing she opened a door as softly as
she could and went in, leaving Zeno on the threshold.
It was the sleeping room, and Zeno heard the captain's
stertorous breathing with relief. He went in and looked
at the sleeping man's face, which was congested to a
dark red by the powerful drug, and Zeno thought it
doubtful whether he would ever wake again. The
woman, ignorant of the effects of much opium, was afraid
her husband might open his eyes, and she plucked at
Zeno's sleeve, anxious to get him away; but the Venetian
smiled.</p>

<p>'He is good for twelve hours' sleep,' he said. 'Give
me his cloak and helmet. If I find no one awake I will
leave them at the outer gate. Otherwise I will send them
to the tower in a clothes-basket to-morrow morning.'</p>

<p>The captain's wife obeyed, less frightened than she
had been at first; Zeno muffled half his face in the big
cloak, and threw the end over his shoulder whence it
hung down, displaying the three broad stripes of gold
lace that formed the border distinctive of a captain's
rank in the guards. The bright helmet had a gilt eagle
for a crest, scarcely differing from that of the modern
German Gardes du Corps regiment.</p>

<p>'Now show me the way,' Zeno said.</p>

<p>Under the folds of the cloak he had the short broad
sheath-knife ready in his grasp, and it was no bad weapon
in the hand of such a fighter as Carlo Zeno. The captain's
wife led the way with the lantern.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_247" id="i_247"></a>
<img src="images/i_247.jpg" width="500" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">The captain's wife obeyed, less frightened than she had been at first.</p>
</div>

<p>At the foot of the next flight of stairs she almost stumbled
over the sentinel, half-seated on the lowest step in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
a drunken sleep; his shaggy head had fallen forwards
on his breast, and his legs stuck straight out before him,
wide apart, like the legs of a wooden doll. His hands
lay open with the palms upwards, one on his knee, the
other on the step beside him; and his helmet, which had
rolled off his head, had happened to stop just between
his feet, the right side up, and facing him, as if it were
watching him in his slumber like a living thing.</p>

<p>The story they had now reached contained the living
room of the captain and his wife, and no sentinel was
needed higher up in the tower. An iron door, fastened
on the inside, cut off the descent, and had to be opened
for Zeno to pass. But being constantly in use the lock
was well oiled, and the bolts slipped back almost without
noise. Nevertheless, as he followed his companion down
the next flight, Zeno drew up the folds of the cloak on
his right arm till the edge barely covered the drawn
knife in his hand.</p>

<p>They reached the next story below, where the upper
guard-room was. The door was half-open, and a lamp
was burning within, but as the window was over the great
court of Blachernæ no light had been visible from the
water. Zeno heard voices, and caught sight of two
guards carousing at the end of an oak table. At the
sound of footsteps one of the men rose quickly, but
staggered when he tried to walk to the door.</p>

<p>'Who goes there?' he called out, steadying himself
by the door-post, and looking out.</p>

<p>The captain's wife had the presence of mind to hold
up the lantern, so that the light fell full upon the helmet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
Zeno wore. Instantly the soldier tried to straighten
himself to an attitude of attention, with his hands by
his sides. But this was too much for his unstable balance,
and he reeled backwards half across the room
within, till he struck the table behind him, and tumbled
down with a clatter of accoutrements and a rattling
of the horn drinking-cups that were thrown to the ground.
His companion, who was altogether too drunk even to
leave his seat, broke into a loud idiotic laugh at his
accident.</p>

<p>'You have done your share well, Kyría,' said Zeno,
as he followed her again. 'The Emperor's friends could
have brought him down by the stairs in triumph without
being stopped.'</p>

<p>'You are not out of the palace precincts yet,' answered
the captain's wife in a warning tone.</p>

<p>She went on, treading more softly as she descended,
and carrying the lantern low lest she or her companion
should stumble over another sleeping sentinel; but the
staircase and the door that led into the court were deserted,
for the captain was a very exact man, and had
his supper at the same hour every evening, and went to
bed soon afterwards like an honest citizen, after setting
the watch and locking the iron door of his own lower
landing. In two years he had never once come down
the tower after sunset. The consequence was that the
guards, who were mostly rough barbarians from the
Don country and the shores of the Black Sea, did as they
pleased, or as their lieutenant pleased; for he found it
pleasant to spend his nights in another part of the palace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
and was extremely popular with his men, because they
were thus enabled to go to bed like good Christians and
sleep all night.</p>

<p>All this the captain's wife knew well enough. Her
apprehension was for what might happen to Zeno between
leaving the tower and passing the great gate, which
was the only way to get out of the fortified precincts.
The wide courtyard was very dark, but there were lights
here and there in the windows of the buildings that surrounded
it on three sides, the great mass of the palace
on the right, the barracks of the guards along the wall
to the left, and the main post at the great gate in front
with the buildings on each side of it, some occupied by
slaves and some used as stables.</p>

<p>Zeno wished that he had stripped one of the sleeping
soldiers and had put on his dress, for he had been informed
of the captain's habits, and knew that the disguise
was no longer a safe one after leaving the tower.
Indeed it was a chief part of the captain's duty never
to go out after dark, on any excuse, and he apparently
made sure of obeying this permanent order by going to
bed early and getting up late. For the rest, he had
always left the personal care of his prisoner to his wife,
judging that her stout middle-age and fiery cheeks sufficiently
protected his domestic honour. She had been
young and very pretty once, it was true, but the captain
did not know that Johannes had even seen her then,
much less did he guess that many years ago, when the
Emperor was a handsome young prince and she was a
lovely girl in the old Empress's train, she had worshipped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
him and he had condescended to accept her admiration
for a few weeks. But this was the truth, as Zeno's grandson
the bishop very clearly explains.</p>

<p>She left her lantern just inside the door and came
out with Carlo into the open air. After walking a few
steps she laid her hand on his arm, stopped, looked round,
and listened. As yet they had not exchanged two
words about the situation, and were far from sure that
the watch which had detected Carlo from the water and
had failed to catch him, had not come round by land to
the palace gate to give the alarm.</p>

<p>Zeno slipped the cloak from his shoulders and wrapped
it round the helmet, so that the captain's wife could
carry both conveniently.</p>

<p>'It is hopeless,' she whispered, as she took them.
'This morning he promised that he would leave the prison
if you could bring him out. He has often spoken to
me as he spoke to you this evening&mdash;he loves the boy
dearly; but I was sure that he had made up his mind to
risk everything, else I would not have shown the red
light.'</p>

<p>'After all,' Zeno observed, 'it is just as well that he
would not come, since we were seen, though I really
believe Gorlias was too much for the men who almost
caught us. He and I together could certainly have
settled them all&mdash;there were only three. I saw them
distinctly when they first jumped ashore, and one was
killed by the fall when I cut the rope. Gorlias silenced
the other two, for if they were alive there would have
been an alarm here by this time.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes,' the woman answered. 'But some one must
have betrayed us. We cannot try that way again.'</p>

<p>'I shall not try that, or any other way again!' Zeno
said with emphasis. 'In the name of the Evangelist,
why should I risk my neck to free a man who prefers
to be a prisoner?'</p>

<p>'The wonder is that you are alive this time!'</p>

<p>'It will not even be safe to communicate by the thread
again. Will you take him a message?'</p>

<p>'As well as I can remember it.'</p>

<p>'Tell him that the next time he asks my help he must
send me, by the same messenger, a deed giving Tenedos
to Venice, signed and sealed. Otherwise I will not
stir!'</p>

<p>'Shall I tell him that?'</p>

<p>'Yes. Tell him so from me. And now, go back,
Kyría, and thank you for your guidance and your lantern
in those dark stairs.'</p>

<p>'How shall you pass the gate?' asked the captain's
wife.</p>

<p>She spoke anxiously, for Zeno was a handsome man,
and she had seen how brave he was.</p>

<p>'I do not know,' he answered, 'but one of two things
must happen.'</p>

<p>'What things?'</p>

<p>'Either I shall get out or I shall never see daylight
again! I shall not let myself be taken alive to be impaled
in the Hippodrome, I assure you. Thank you
again, and good-night.'</p>

<p>She drew back into the shadow of the tower door and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
watched the handsome young man with the peculiar
half-motherly, half-sentimental anxiety of the middle-aged
woman, who was a flirt in her youth and turned
the heads of just such men, who knows that she is grown
fat and ugly and can never turn the head of another,
but who has preserved many tender and pleasant recollections
of all the sex.</p>

<p>Zeno did not walk straight towards the gate, though
it was easily distinguished from the adjacent buildings
by the greater number of its lights. He crossed the
wide court diagonally to the right, in the direction of
the stables, till he was near enough to see distinctly
any one who chanced to come under the rays of one of
the scattered lamps that burned here and there in doorways
and open windows. Before long he saw a trooper
of the guards emerging rather unsteadily out of the darkness
into one of these small circles of light. Zeno could
not help smiling to himself at the idea that there was
hardly one sober man awake among the guards that
night, and that they had all drunk themselves stupid
with his money.</p>

<p>He overtook the man in half-a-dozen strides, and spoke
to him in a low voice.</p>

<p>'Hi! comrade! You who are still perfectly sober,
help a friend who is very drunk!'</p>

<p>The man stopped, steadied himself, and answered
with ponderous gravity.</p>

<p>'Perfectly&mdash;hic&mdash;hic&mdash;sober!'</p>

<p>'I wish I were!' replied Zeno. 'The truth is, I am
exceedingly drunk, though I do not show it. Wine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
only affects my brains, never my legs or my tongue.
It is a very strange thing!'</p>

<p>'Very&mdash;cu&mdash;hic&mdash;rious!' responded the soldier, trying
to see his interlocutor clearly, by screwing up his eyes.</p>

<p>'Extraordinarily cuhicrious, as you justly observe,'
Zeno answered gravely. 'But the fact is&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Excuse me&mdash;hic,' interrupted the soldier. 'Are you
one man&mdash;hic&mdash;or two men?'</p>

<p>'One man,' Zeno answered. 'Only one, and so drunk
that I have quite forgotten the password.'</p>

<p>'Sec&mdash;hic&mdash;ret,' hiccoughed the man. 'Password
secret,' he repeated, with a tremendous effort.</p>

<p>'Here is a gold piece, my dear friend. You will help
a comrade in trouble.'</p>

<p>The man took the money eagerly, and tried to put it
into his wallet. To do so he had to bend his head down
so as to see the thongs that fastened it. It took a long
time to find them.</p>

<p>'Just give me the password before you do that,' Zeno
said in a coaxing tone.</p>

<p>'Password?' The man looked up stupidly.</p>

<p>The effort of undoing the thongs had been too much
for him, and had sent the blood to his head. He staggered
against the Venetian, and tried to speak. After
many efforts he got the words out suddenly.</p>

<p>'Drunk, by Moses!' he cried, quite distinctly, as he
fell in a heap at Zeno's feet.</p>

<p>In his vexation Zeno could have kicked the stupid
mass of humanity across the great yard, but he was far
too wise to waste his time so unprofitably. Instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
kicking him he stepped across him, thrust his hands
under the unconscious man's armpits, hove him up like
a sack of flour, got him over his shoulder, and carried
him to the open door of the nearest stable, whence the
light came. Five horses stood or lay in their stalls,
but the sixth stall was vacant, and there was fresh straw
in it. Zeno threw the man down there, and looked
round, to see that no one else was in the place. He hesitated
a moment as to whether he should shut the door,
but decided that to do so might attract the attention of
a sober man, if there were any about, which was doubtful.</p>

<p>The trooper was now sound asleep, and it was the work
of a few moments to pull off his boots of soft leather and
slip them on, for Zeno had left his own in the boat, and
had walked in his cloth hose; he took off the soldier's
sword-belt and tunic next, the latter of rich scarlet cloth
trimmed with heavy silver lace, the belt being entirely
covered with silver scales. The drunken sleeper grunted
with satisfaction when he felt himself relieved of his
useless clothes, and settled himself comfortably in the
straw while Zeno put on the tunic over his own buff
jerkin and drew the belt tight round his waist, settled
the man's tall Greek cap on his own head at the proper
angle, as the troopers wore it, and threw the military
cloak over his arm.</p>

<p>He could now easily pass himself for a trooper at the
gate, and a man who has been a soldier is rarely at a
loss amongst soldiers, especially if he wears a uniform.
In consideration of what he had taken, Zeno, who was
an honest man of business, left the man his wallet with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
the piece of gold and anything else it might contain, and
after carefully removing a few wisps of straw that clung
to his clothes, he went towards the door of the
stable.</p>

<p>His plan was to saunter to the gate and loiter there
till a chance offered of opening the small night-postern
in the great door, which he had noticed in passing the
palace when the gates were open. The fact of his being
sober when almost every one else was more or less intoxicated,
would give him a great advantage.</p>

<p>But as he turned from the sleeper and walked along
the line from the empty stall, which was the last, his
eye fell on the saddles and bridles, neatly arranged on
stout pegs that projected from the walls, each set opposite
the stall of the horse to which it belonged. He
peered out into the wide court, and listened for the sound
of voices. From very far away he heard the echo of a
drinking chorus, less loud than the noise made behind
him by one of the horses that had a fancy for a mouthful
of hay just then, and was chewing it conscientiously
as only animals can chew.</p>

<p>All was very quiet outside. Zeno changed his plan,
turned back into the stable, and began to saddle the
horse farthest from the door. He did not mean to ride
far, else he would have picked out his mount with all the
judgement he possessed. There was but a dash to make,
and it was far more important that no passing trooper
should see him in the act of putting on saddle and bridle
than that he should have the best horse under him afterwards.
Besides, they were all big, hay-fed animals,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
sleek and sleepy, mostly white Tunisians, and much more
fit for a procession than a campaign.</p>

<p>When he had finished, he led the charger past the
other stalls, stopping just before he reached the door
to put out the oil lamp that hung by the entrance.
This done, he slipped his arm through the bridle and
left the stable. He struck across the deserted court
towards the palace, until he was almost in the middle
of the yard, and opposite the great gate, towards which
he looked steadily for some seconds, trying to make out,
by the uncertain light that dimly illuminated it from
within, whether the doors under the arch were open or
shut. There was just a possibility that they might
be open. It was worth trying for; and after all, if they
were barred, he was sure that he could impose upon
the sentinels to open them. A man accustomed to command
does not doubt that he must be obeyed when he
asserts himself.</p>

<p>Zeno mounted the big horse, which was as quiet as any
old circus hack in the Hippodrome, trained to let a
dancing-girl skip the rope on his broad back. His rider
put him from a walk to a canter, and from a canter to a
thundering gallop that roused echoes all round the
court.</p>

<p>As he came near he saw that the doors were shut, but
he did not slacken speed till he was almost upon the
startled sentinels. Then he drew rein suddenly, as was
the practice of horsemanship in those days, and the great
Tunisian threw himself back on his haunches with outstretched
forefeet, while Zeno called out to the watch.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>'On the Emperor's service!' he shouted. 'The gates,
and quickly!'</p>

<p>The sentinels were tolerably sober, for they were
not to get their full share of the flood of wine that was
flowing till their guard was relieved. But they could
hardly be blamed for obeying Zeno's imperative command.
It was not likely that a guardsman of their
troop who wished to slip out of barracks for a night's
amusement would dress himself in full uniform and come
galloping and shouting to the gate, nor that any trooper
would dare to pretend that he rode on the Emperor's
business if it were not true.</p>

<p>The two sentinels therefore did not hesitate, but set
their long cavalry lances upright against the walls on
either side, took down the bar, and laid hold of the ponderous
gates, each man taking one and throwing himself
backwards with all his weight to move it. When once
started, the doors swung slowly but easily backwards.
Zeno sat motionless in the saddle, ready to dash forward
as soon as there was room for him to pass. He had halted
just far enough away to allow the doors to swing clear
of his horse's head as they were pulled inward. It was
an anxious moment.</p>

<p>A second more and there would be space between the
yawning gates. But that second had not yet passed
when a tall officer in scarlet rushed shouting from the
open door of the guard-house, and seized Zeno's
bridle.</p>

<p>'Stop him!' yelled the lieutenant. 'Shut the gates!'</p>

<p>The two soldiers did their best to obey instantly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
but the leaves of the gate were of cypress wood four
inches thick, and covered with bronze, and were swinging
back faster now under the impulse they had received.
It was impossible to check them suddenly, and the order
was hardly spoken when Zeno saw that there was room
to ride through.</p>

<p>He would have given his fortune for a pair of Arab
spurs at that moment, but he struck the corners of his
heels at the horse's sides with all his might, and almost
lifted him by the bridle at the same time. The big
Tunisian answered the call upon his strength better than
the rider had dared to hope; he gathered himself and
lifted his forequarters, shaking his head savagely to get
rid of the hands that grasped the off rein close to the
bit, and then he dashed forwards, straight between the
doors, throwing the officer to the ground and dragging
him violently away in the powerful stride of his heavy
gallop.</p>

<p>Seeing what had happened the sentinels started in
pursuit at full speed, following the sound of the charger's
shoes on the cobble-stones rather than anything they
could see, for it was as dark as pitch outside.</p>

<p>The officer, who was very active and seemed indifferent
to the frightful risk he ran, still clung to the bridle, regained
his feet, ran nimbly by the side of the galloping
horse, and seemed about to spring up and close with Zeno
to drag him from the saddle. Zeno had no weapon within
reach now, for his knife was in his own belt, under the
belted tunic he wore over his clothes, and he could not
possibly get at it. But the officer was unarmed, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
as he had sprung from his couch, and was at a great disadvantage
on foot.</p>

<p>They dashed on into the darkness of the broad street.
Zeno bent down, and tried to get at his adversary's
collar with his right hand, but the officer dodged him and
jerked the bridle with desperate energy, bringing the
Tunisian to a stand after one more furious plunge.
At the same instant Zeno heard the footsteps of the two
guardsmen running up behind, and he realised that the
odds were three to one against him, and that he had no
weapon in his hand. The troopers, of course, had their
Greek sabres. If he could not escape, he must either
be taken alive or cut to pieces on the spot, with no defence
but his bare hands.</p>

<p>He did not hesitate. The officer, dragging down the
charger's head by his weight to stop him, was almost on
his knees for a moment, on the off side, of course, and the
soldiers had not yet come up. Zeno dropped the reins,
sprang from the saddle, and ran for his life.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p>Zoë sat in the dark just within the open doorway
of Zeno's house, before the marble steps. She was
shivering with cold, now that the danger to herself
was over, and she was bent with pain, though she
scarcely knew she was hurt; for she was conscious
only of her anxiety for Zeno. If he got out of the tower
and reached his home, he would certainly come in by that
door, since he had left it open, and the one on the land
side was barred; and there was a way of coming round
the house to the water's edge without entering the gate
or passing through the fore-court.</p>

<p>Zeno had unconsciously stepped upon her body with
his whole weight in getting out, when she lay hidden in
the bottom of the boat, but she would rather have died
than have made a sound or winced under the pressure.
And now her side hurt her, and the pain ran down to
her knee and her foot, so that she had hardly been able to
walk after Gorlias had helped her ashore.</p>

<p>It had been impossible to hinder her from getting in,
when she had run down to the landing while Zeno was
changing his clothes; there had not been time, and she
had not waited to argue the question, but had simply
whispered to Gorlias that she was going, and that he
must hide her as well as he could, and say nothing.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
He was not a man to be easily surprised, and he reflected
that as she was in the secret, and as it was her influence
that had decided Zeno to act at last, she might possibly
be useful; as indeed she afterwards proved herself to
be. Besides, Gorlias thought it likely that Zeno had told
her all his plans, although he did not wish to take her
with him; for the astrologer was not at all clear as to
the relations existing between the master and the
slave.</p>

<p>She sat alone and shivering in the dark. Gorlias
had left her and had hastened back to the foot of the
tower to remove all traces of the unsuccessful attempt
before daybreak, by throwing the dead body into the
water with a weight, and carrying off the gear that had
been left lying on the sloping pier. Zoë thought he must
be of iron. He had been some time in the water in his
clothes, and had probably been more or less bruised in
the struggle, and in rolling down the stones, if not by
the fall at the end. But he seemed as calm and collected
as ever, and apparently had no idea of drying himself
before morning.</p>

<p>Zoë thought of him only very vaguely as of a person
connected with Zeno, round whom alone the whole
world had moved since she had known that he loved her;
and in her imagination she followed him on after he had
reached the tower window the second time and had
whistled the call that told her he was safe so far.</p>

<p>It was agonising to think of his danger. She did not
believe that he could possibly escape from within the
prison through the palace precincts; in some way or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
other he must succeed in climbing down the wall again,
and Gorlias would find him and bring him home. But
when she had said this to the astrologer, he had shaken
his head. There were good reasons why Zeno should not
attempt the perilous descent that night, when there had
just been an alarm from below of which it was not possible
to let him know the result. Moreover, no one knew
whether the man whom Zoë had struck had sunk and
was drowned, or had parried the blow with his arm and
had succeeded in swimming ashore. Neither Gorlias nor
Zoë knew that yet, and they might never know it.</p>

<p>She waited, but not a sound disturbed the silence
of the chilly night. Within the house every one was
sleeping; the two little slave-girls, curled up on their
carpet in the corner, where Zoë had left them, would not
wake till dawn; Omobono slept the sleep of the just
in his small bedroom behind the counting-house, dreaming
of the mysteries of four toes and five toes, and quenching
his insatiable curiosity at last in the overflowing
fountain of fancy. As for the servants and slaves, all
slumbered profoundly, after the way of their kind.</p>

<p>But Zeno did not come. Zoë crouched in the doorway,
and drew the skirts of her long Greek coat round
her little white feet more than half instinctively, for she
did not care if she died of the cold, since he did not
come.</p>

<p>A mad longing seized her to go out into the city to
look for him in the dark and silent streets; he might
be lying somewhere, wounded and alone, perhaps left
for dead; if she did not come upon him she would push
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
on to the great gate of Blachernæ; and she was sure that
she could find the way, though it was far. She would
slip in, unnoticed by the sentries; she would pass herself
for a woman of the palace, where she had often been
taken by Kyría Agatha in the happy days; she remembered
where the great tower stood in the corner of the
palace yard, the farthest corner to the right, and she
could almost see its door, though indeed she had never
noticed one. He was somewhere behind it, somewhere
in there, above or below ground, caught in the trap,
waiting for the dawn of his dying day. For Andronicus
would not let him live. If he was taken, his hours were
numbered. He must die the death Michael Rhangabé
had died; there was none more cruel.</p>

<p>As she thought of it, there alone in the cold, a sharp
pain bit at her heart, and in the gloom she could no
longer make out the white marble steps, the chequered
black-and-white pavement, nor the last unextinguished
lights of Pera reflected in the water; she saw nothing,
and she sank back against the step behind her, fainting
and unconscious.</p>

<p>She lay there alone, quite still; but he did not come.
When she opened her eyes again she thought she had
fallen asleep, and was angry with herself at the thought
of having rested while he was in danger of his life. She
would go out to find him, come what might. Then she
tried to get upon her feet, and was startled to find that
she could not. Chilled to the bone and bruised as
she was, she could not move her limbs, and she wondered
in terror whether she were paralysed. But she was brave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
still, and after a time she managed to turn on one side,
and with her hands on the cold step she laboriously got
upon her knees. Sensation came back and pain with it,
and presently she was able to raise herself by holding
the edge of the door, first on one knee, then on her feet.
But that was all, and she knew that she could do no
more. Perhaps she might crawl upstairs by and by,
after resting a little.</p>

<p>She stood still a long time, holding the door and hesitating,
for in her intense anxiety it seemed impossible
to think of giving up and going to bed. He must come.
It would be late, it might be daylight, but he must come;
for if he came not, that could only mean that he was
taken, and if he was taken he must die.</p>

<p>Again the pain bit savagely at her heart, but she set
her lips and grasped the door with both hands, and
refused to let herself faint.</p>

<p>She could at least rouse Omobono and the household
to go out and search for the master. She had almost
let go of the door to make the first step forward, when
the counter-thought checked her. The attempt to
free the Emperor had been made very secretly; if she
called the secretary, the servants, the slaves, she would
be revealing that secret, and if, by some miracle, Zeno
were still free and safe, some one might betray him.
Some one must have betrayed him already, else the
watch would not have come upon him exactly at the
most critical moment. The three men had been lurking
near, waiting till he was on the rope the second time,
and expecting to catch him in the very act of bringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
out the prisoner. Who was the traitor? Most probably
some one in the house. It would not be wise to
call the servants, after all.</p>

<p>The hopelessness of it all came over the lonely girl
now, and she almost let herself sink down again upon
the steps to wait till daylight, if need be, for the awful
news that was sure to reach her only too soon. Gorlias
would bring it, and no one else.</p>

<p>But she was too proud to give way altogether, unless
she fainted outright. It was torture, but she would
bear it, as he would if he were taken. Perhaps at that
very moment they were questioning him before Andronicus,
twisting his handsome limbs till the joints cracked,
or holding red-hot irons close to his blistering feet.
He would set his teeth and turn white, but he would not
speak; he would be torn piecemeal and die, but his tormentors
would not get a word from him, not a syllable.
Again and again, she felt the pain in imagination; but
she wished that she could indeed feel it for him, and be
in his place at that moment, if he were suffering. The
pain would be less, even the pain of the rack and the
glowing irons, than the agony of being powerless to help
him.</p>

<p>Now, the time seemed endless; now, again, an hour
passed quickly in a waking dream, wherein Zeno was
vividly before her, and she lived again the moments
that had taught her the truth in the touch of his lips.
Then, the world was dark once more and she was alone
and shivering, and mad with anxiety for the one living
thing she loved.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<p>He did not come. The northern stars sank to the
west and he did not come; they touched the horizon,
yet he did not come; an icy breath foreran the coming
dawn, and still he came not, but still Zoë waited.</p>

<p>Then the stars faded, and the sky was less black, and
she thought day was coming; but it was the faint light
of the waning moon rising above the Bosphorus. It was
not light, now, but the thick darkness had become transparent;
it was possible to see through it, and Zoë saw
a skiff come silently alongside the landing. It was Gorlias;
he moored the craft quickly and came up the steps.
Zoë had recognised his outline, because she expected
him, and she made a step to meet him, though it hurt
her very much to move. He came quickly and securely,
as men do who can see at night, like cats and wild animals;
when he was near, Zoë even fancied that his eyes
emitted a faint light of their own in the dark, but her
imagination was no doubt disturbed by her bodily pain
and terrible mental anxiety.</p>

<p>'Has he not come yet?' Gorlias asked in a low
tone.</p>

<p>The question could only mean that Zeno was taken,
and Zoë grasped the astrologer's arm in sudden fear.</p>

<p>'He is lost!' she exclaimed. 'They will kill him to-morrow!'</p>

<p>'It is not easy to kill Carlo Zeno,' answered Gorlias,
rubbing his stiffened hands, and then slowly pulling
each finger in succession till the joints cracked. 'He is
not dead yet,' he added.</p>

<p>'Not yet!' echoed Zoë despairingly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<p>'No,' said Gorlias, 'for he got out of the palace.'</p>

<p>'Got out? You are sure?' Zoë could have screamed
for joy; the revulsion was almost too sudden.</p>

<p>'Yes, I am sure of that. There is a search for him
in all the quarters about the palace. When I had cleared
everything away below the tower, I dropped downstream
to a quiet place I know, and went ashore to learn
what I could. The great gate of Blachernæ was open,
the court was full of lights, and the guards had been called
out. Half of them were reeling about, still very drunk,
but I met many that were more sober, searching the
streets and lanes with lanterns. I lingered till the same
party found me twice and looked at me suspiciously, and
then I slipped away again and came here. I do not
believe any of them know whom they are looking for;
they have only been told that some one has broken out of
the palace, I suppose. That made me think that Zeno
had come quietly home, quite sure that he had not been
recognised.'</p>

<p>Gorlias told his story in the low, monotonous tone
peculiar to him, which seemed to express the most perfect
indifference to anything that might happen. But Zoë
cared nothing for his way of telling what was just then
the best possible news. Zeno was not safe yet, but she
knew him well enough to feel sure that if he had not been
taken within the palace, he had little to fear. Sooner
or later he would come home, as if nothing had happened.
Gorlias understood her sigh of relief.</p>

<p>'You must go in and rest, Kokóna,' he said, and he
quietly pushed her towards the door. 'I will watch till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
daylight in the boat, in case he should come and need
anything.'</p>

<p>She could hardly walk, and he now noticed her lameness
for the first time, and asked the cause of it.</p>

<p>'He stepped on me when I was lying under the canvas,'
she answered. 'But it is nothing,' she added quietly.
'I hardly felt anything at first.'</p>

<p>'I will carry you,' said Gorlias.</p>

<p>Before she could prevent him, he had lifted her in his
arms and was carrying her into the house. He knew
the way up to her apartment, having been to see her
there, and he stepped easily and surely with his burden,
his bare feet hardly making any sound on the marble
steps. She lay across his arms like a thing without
weight, borne along as a maid carries a fresh gown that
she is afraid of ruffling. But the man's arms and clothes
were wet and cold, and even his breath chilled her.</p>

<p>Her nerves were overwrought, and she was foolishly
frightened now. The stairs were very dark, and the
touch of the man who carried her was like that of a wet
monster of night, cold and horribly strong, holding her
and carrying her in his vast arms as the autumn night
wind whirls the leaves along. He never paused for
breath, he never stopped to try and see the steps under
his feet; he only went on and up, up, up, till she fancied
she was not in Zeno's house, but in some high and mysterious
tower to which she had been suddenly transported
by an awful being from another world who was taking
her to the top and would hurl her from the highest turret
into space.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_271" id="i_271"></a>
<img src="images/i_271.jpg" width="550" height="452" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Saw her sink down there exhausted, and draw a heavy silk shawl across her body.</p>
</div>

<p>But now Gorlias stood still and set her on her feet
at her own door, steadying her by her shoulders, and
guiding her in, for he could see the ray of light that
crept out between the curtain and the doorpost of the
inner entrance.</p>

<p>He lifted the heavy stuff and still supported her with
his other hand. After being so long in the dark the light
of the little lamps was dazzling, though they were burning
low. Three or four of them had already gone out,
and the acrid smell of the burnt-out olive-oil and the
singed wicks hung in the air.</p>

<p>Gorlias watched Zoë while she limped over the thick
carpet to the divan, and he saw her sink down there
exhausted, and draw a heavy silk shawl across her body.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' she sighed, as her weary head pressed the
pillow at last.</p>

<p>But he had already dropped the curtain again and
was gone, and almost at the same instant she shut her
eyes and fell asleep.</p>

<p>Gorlias reached the bottom of the stairs without
waking any one, closed the door, which he could not
fasten, and got into his boat to wait for Zeno until daybreak,
and also to watch lest any one should try to
enter the house.</p>

<p>But no one came, neither Zeno, nor any messenger
from him, nor any stealthy thief; and at last the dawn
rose behind Constantinople and dissolved the night, and
the poor waning moon had not much light left and almost
went out altogether as the day broke. Then
Gorlias drew his oars inboard, and laid them across the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
boat before him, leaning his elbows on them and resting
his chin upon his folded hands, like a man in deep
thought; and he let the craft drift slowly away towards
the Bosphorus, into the morning mist.</p>

<p>Also, the dawn crept into the house between the half-closed
shutters of Zoë's room and made the lingering flame
of the last lamp seem but a smoky little yellow point
in the cold clearness; and the girl's pale face, that had
taken a golden tinge from the lamplight, now turned as
white as silver.</p>

<p>Also, the coming sun waked Omobono, and he sat
up in bed and gravely rubbed his eyes, quite unaware that
anything had happened during the night; and it roused
the slaves and the servants, and presently all the house
was astir; and Yulia and Lucilla got up too and came
softly and stood beside Zoë, who did not stir, and they
wondered at her deep sleep and at the weariness of her
face, and at the look of pain all about her mouth.</p>

<p>But where Zeno was the light did not enter; for dawn
and sunset, and noon and midnight were all alike there.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p>When Zeno slipped from his borrowed charger and ran
for his life towards that part of the square that looked
darkest, he had no time to choose the direction he would
afterwards take, nor to think of anything but covering
the ground at the greatest possible speed without stumbling
over an unseen obstacle. On those singular occasions
when a perfectly brave man has no choice but to
run, there is not much time to spare.</p>

<p>The young Venetian strained his strength and his
wind to get as far as he could from his pursuers in the
shortest possible time, and he was so successful that he
was out of their reach almost before they were aware
that he had fled.</p>

<p>At first he had run straight across the wide open space
before Blachernæ; he had then found the entrance to a
street which he had followed for about fifty yards, and
he had turned a corner to his left without meeting any
one; he had rushed on without pausing till he judged it
time to double again and had then turned to the right.
A few steps farther on, he stopped short and listened,
believing himself alone and not at all sure where he was.</p>

<p>Suddenly a light flashed in his face, very near him.</p>

<p>'Is it time?' asked a low voice in Greek, and the
lantern was closed again, leaving him dazzled.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>

<p>Accident, or his fate, had taken him into the very
midst of the men he had enlisted in the cause of the
revolution, to storm the palace before daybreak. They
had waited two hours and were impatient, and even
before Zeno answered the question they saw that matters
had gone ill with him.</p>

<p>'There is an alarm,' he said hurriedly. 'I barely got
away. Disperse quickly, and get to your quarters, all
of you! I will let you know when we can do it.'</p>

<p>A murmur of discontent came from the invisible crowd
of soldiers. Zeno knew them to be a desperate crew,
who would hold him responsible for failure, and would
not thank him for success.</p>

<p>'We must separate at once,' he said calmly. 'I thank
you for having been ready. If possible, we will meet
a week from to-night.'</p>

<p>He did not choose to let them know that Johannes
himself had refused to quit the tower, and he was about
to leave them, meaning to find his way home alone,
when the sound of feet moving behind him, and of men
whispering together told him that he was surrounded
on all sides by the soldiers. Then some one spoke in a
tone of authority.</p>

<p>'You must stay with us,' the voice said. 'You have
our lives in your hand, and we cannot let you go. It
might suit your interests to give us up to the Emperor
any day.'</p>

<p>Seeing his liberty threatened, Zeno laid his hand to the
knife at the back of his belt and was about to try and
break his way through. In the dark, a man with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
drawn weapon in his hand easily inspires terror in a
crowd. But it was clear that the soldiers had determined
beforehand what to do, for they closed in upon
him instantly, and his arm was caught by a dozen hands
when he was in the very act of drawing his knife. He
was held by twenty men, as it seemed to him, who all
took hold of him and lifted him from the ground, not
very roughly, but irresistibly. He had no chance against
so many; Gorlias Pietrogliant himself could have done
nothing, and he was far stronger than Zeno, stronger
perhaps than any man in Constantinople.</p>

<p>Zeno knew that it would be worse than useless to shout
for help; at his first cry he would most likely be strangled
by men whose own lives were more or less at stake.
They carried him quickly along the street and through
unfamiliar and narrow ways which he could hardly have
recognised even in broad daylight, much less at night.
They turned sharp corners to the right, to the left,
to the right again, and he thought he could distinguish
the broken outlines of a ruined wall against the faint
greyness of the ink-and-water sky.</p>

<p>Then all was dark for an instant, and he felt that his
bearers were pausing at some obstacle or difficulty. The
lantern flashed again, and he saw a rough vault above
him; there was a big cobweb just above his head, and a
loathsome fat spider jumped out of a crevice and ran
along the threads till it disappeared as if by magic in the
very middle of the web. He saw it in an instant in the
sudden light as some one held up the lantern to show the
way. Such things take hold of the memory and stick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
to it afterwards, as little burs fasten themselves upon
one's clothes in autumn fields. Besides, though Zeno
was one of the bravest men of any age, he detested fat
spiders, and was very nearly afraid of them.</p>

<p>He felt himself carried down an inclined plane at a
swinging rate; the air smelt of dry earth, and presently
it grew much warmer, though it was not at all close. It
seemed a long time until the men stopped, set him on
his feet, and left their hold on him. The man who had
acted as the leader now pushed the others aside, and stood
before him, a broad-shouldered Tartar with a huge tawny
beard, dressed in leather and wearing a breastplate
embossed with the Roman eagle. Zeno knew him well;
he was a Mohammedan, like many soldiers of fortune
in the Greek army at that time, his name was Tocktamish,
and he had been with Zeno in Patras. He spoke
a barbarous dialect, compounded of Greek and Italian.</p>

<p>'Messer Zeno,' he said, 'we are not going to hurt you,
but we think it better for your own safety to keep you
here for a while, till everything is quiet again. Do you
understand?'</p>

<p>'Perfectly,' Zeno answered, with a laugh. 'Nothing
could be clearer! You naturally suppose that if I
found myself in danger I would turn evidence against
you to save myself, and you propose to make that
impossible.'</p>

<p>Tocktamish pretended to be hurt.</p>

<p>'How can you think that I could take my old leader
for a traitor, sir?' he asked.</p>

<p>'The idea would occur naturally to a man of your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
intelligence,' Zeno answered, laughing again. 'Listen
to me, man. I am a soldier, and I do not take you for
a flight of angels or heavenly doves settling round me
for my consolation. You are an infernal deal more like
a pack of wolves! So let us be plain, as wolves generally
are when they are hungry. You joined me because
you hoped to be plundering the palace by this time.
As that has failed, you want something instead. You
know very well that I am not the man to betray a comrade,
and that if I am free I shall probably get Johannes
out of his prison in the end. But you expect something
now. How much do you want?'</p>

<p>The Tartar looked down sheepishly and passed his
thumb round the lower edge of his corselet, backwards
and forwards, as if he were slowly polishing the
steel.</p>

<p>'Come,' continued Zeno, 'what is the use of hanging
back? As I could not succeed in turning you all into
patriots to-night and regenerators of your country, you
have, of course, turned yourselves into bandits; you
have got me a prisoner, and you want a ransom. How
much is it to be?'</p>

<p>Tocktamish still hesitated, feeling very much ashamed
of himself before his old captain.</p>

<p>'Well, sir, you see&mdash;there are eight hundred of us&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'And if any one gets less than the rest he will sell all
your skins to Andronicus for the balance,' laughed
Zeno. 'Quite right, too! I love justice above all
things.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>'Then give us ten ducats each,' cried the clear voice
of a Greek from the background.</p>

<p>'Ten ducats apiece will make eight thousand,' said
Zeno. 'I am sorry, but I have not so much money at
my disposal.'</p>

<p>'You can borrow,' answered the Greek.</p>

<p>'I am afraid not, my friend.' He turned to the Tartar
leader again. 'You are a fool, Tocktamish,' he said
calmly. 'As long as you keep me here I cannot get
money at all. Do you suppose that we merchants put
away thousands of ducats in strong boxes under our
beds? If we did that, you would have broken into
our houses long ago, to help yourselves!'</p>

<p>'What promise will you make, sir?' inquired the
Tartar, beginning to waver.</p>

<p>But half-a-dozen voices protested.</p>

<p>'No promises!' they cried. 'Let him send you for
the money!'</p>

<p>'You hear them?' said Tocktamish.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered Zeno, 'I hear them. Their nonsense
will not change facts. If you had the souls of mice in
your miserable bodies,' he continued, turning to the
men with a contemptuous little laugh, 'you would come
with me now and seize the palace. The gates are open,
and the guards are all beastly drunk. There will be
more than eight thousand ducats to divide there!'</p>

<p>The men were silent; many shook their heads.</p>

<p>'The moment is passed,' answered the Tartar, speaking
for them. 'The whole city is roused by this time.'</p>

<p>'We shall have so many more good men to help us,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
then,' Zeno said. 'Not that we need any one. A handful
could do the work.'</p>

<p>'Send for the money!' cried the voice of the Greek
again.</p>

<p>'I have told you that I have not got it,' Zeno answered.
'If you have nothing more sensible to say, go to your
quarters and let me sleep.'</p>

<p>'Pleasant dreams!' jeered the Greek; and several
men laughed.</p>

<p>'I hope my dreams will be pleasant, for I am extremely
sleepy,' Zeno answered carelessly. 'If you cut my throat
before I wake you will get nothing at all, not even my
funeral expenses! Now good-night, and be off!'</p>

<p>'We had better leave him,' Tocktamish said, pushing
the nearest men away. 'You will get nothing at present,
and it is impossible to frighten him. But he cannot
get out, as you know. It is for our own safety, sir,' he
added, changing his tone as he addressed Zeno. 'We
cannot let you out till the city is quiet again, but you
shall lack nothing. There are two cloaks for you to
sleep on and for covering yourself, and I will bring you
food and drink, and anything you want, in the morning.'</p>

<p>Zeno had found time to look about him during the
conversation, as far as the light of the lanterns and the
men who crowded upon him allowed him to see. He
had understood very soon that he was not in the cellar
of a ruined house, as he had at first supposed, but in one
of those great disused cisterns, of which there are several
in Constantinople, and of which two may still be seen.
Centuries had passed since there had been water in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
one, and the dust lay thick on the paved floor. Two
or three score columns of grey marble supported the
high vaulted roof, in which Zeno guessed that there was
no longer any visible opening to the outer air. Yet air
there was, in abundance, for it entered by the narrow
entrance through which Zeno had been carried in, and
probably found its way out through the disused aqueduct
which had once supplied the water, and which still
communicated with some distant exit. Zeno could only
guess at this from his experience of fortresses, which
always contained some similar cistern; every one he had
seen was provided with openings, almost always both
at the top; a few had staircases in order that men might
more conveniently go down to clean them when they
were empty.</p>

<p>His captors left him reluctantly at the bidding of their
chief. They set one lantern against a pillar and filed
out, carrying away the other. Zeno listened to their
departing footsteps for a moment, when the last man
had gone out, and then he went quickly to the entrance
and listened again. In two or three minutes he heard
what he expected; a heavy door creaked and was shut
with a loud noise that boomed down the inclined passage.
Then came another sound, which was not that of bolt
or bar, and was worse to hear. The men were rolling
big loose stones against the door to keep it shut&mdash;two,
three, more, a dozen at least, a weight no one man could
push outward. Then there was no more noise, and Zeno
was alone.</p>

<p>His situation was serious, and his face was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
thoughtful as he went back to the lantern and picked
up one of the two cloaks Tocktamish had left him. He
put it on and drew it closely round him, for he was beginning
to feel cold in spite of the heavy guardsman's
tunic he wore over his own clothes.</p>

<p>He thought of Arethusa, as he called Zoë; she had
been in his mind constantly, and most of all in each of
the moments of danger through which he had passed
since he had left her. He thought of her lying awake
on her divan in the soft light of the small lamps, waiting
to hear his footsteps on the landing below her window,
then falling gently asleep out of sheer weariness, to dream
of him; starting in her rest, perhaps, as she dreamt
that he was in peril, but smiling again, without opening
her eyes, when the vision changed, and he held her in his
arms once more. He little guessed what that yielding
something beneath the canvas had been, on which he
had pressed his foot so heavily when he had stepped
ashore. She was happily ignorant, he fancied, of the
succession of hairbreadth escapes through which he had
passed unhurt so far. What weighed most on his mind,
after all, was the thought that when he met her he should
have to tell her that he had failed.</p>

<p>But he was not thinking of her only as he sat there, for
his own situation stared him in the face, and he could
not think of Arethusa without wondering whether he
was ever to see her again. He had heard those big stones
rolled to the door, and something told him that neither
Tocktamish nor his men would bring the promised bread
and water in the morning. They did not believe that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
he was unable to pay the ransom they demanded, and
they meant to starve him into yielding. But he had
spoken the truth; he had not such a sum of money at his
command. The question was, what the end would be.
For the present they had not left him so much as a jug
of water, and he suddenly realised that he was thirsty
after his many exertions. He could not help laughing
to himself at the idea that he might die of thirst in a
cistern.</p>

<p>But it was not in him to waste time in idly reflecting
on the detestable irony of his fate, when there was any
possibility that his own action might help him. He rose
again and took up the lantern to make a systematic
examination of his prison. After all, Tocktamish and
his soldiers must have acted on the spur of the moment,
and though they evidently knew the entrance to the
cistern, and had probably been aware that it had a door
which could be shut, it was not impossible that there
might be another way out which they had overlooked in
their haste.</p>

<p>But Zeno could find none, and the place was not so
large as he had at first supposed. He counted eight
columns in each direction, which gave sixty-four for
the whole number, and he guessed the cistern to be
about one hundred feet square. The walls were covered
with smooth cement, to which the dust hardly adhered,
and which extended upwards to the spring of the vault,
at the same level as the capitals of the columns. There
was no opening to be found except the one entrance.
Zeno followed the steep inclined passage upwards till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
he reached the closed door which, as he well understood,
must be at a considerable distance from the cistern.
It was made of oak, and though it might have been in
its place a couple of hundred years it was still perfectly
sound. The lock had been wrenched off long ago,
probably to be used for some neighbouring house, but
Zeno had heard the stones rolled up outside the door,
and even before he tried it, he knew that he could not
make it move.</p>

<p>He wondered whether Tocktamish had set a watch,
and he called out and listened for an answer, but none
came; he shouted, with the same result. Then he took
up his lantern and went down again, for it was clear
that the soldiers thought him so safely confined that
it would not be necessary to guard the entrance. Since
that was their opinion, there was nothing to be done but
to agree with them. Zeno lay down in the dust, rolled
himself in the spare cloak, placing a doubled fold of it
between his head and the base of a column, and he was
soon fast asleep.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p>There was consternation in little Omobono's face
the next morning when he learnt that his master had
gone out during the night, and had not come home.
The secretary would not believe it at first, and he went
himself to Zeno's bedroom and saw that the couch had
not been slept on; he could tell that easily, though it
was not a bed but a narrow divan covered with a carpet;
for the two leathern pillows were not disturbed, and the
old dark red cloak which Zeno always used as a covering
was neatly folded in its place. It had been with him
through the long campaign in Greece, and he had the
almost affectionate associations with it which men of
action often connect with objects that have served them
well in dangerous times.</p>

<p>Zeno had not slept at home, and he had changed his
clothes before going out. Questioned by Omobono,
Vito could not say with any certainty what the master
had put on; in fact, he could not tell at all. All the
cloth hose and doublets and tunics were in their places
in the cedar wardrobes and chests of drawers, except
those he had taken off, which lay on a chair. It looked,
said the servant, as if the master had gone out without
any clothes at all!</p>

<p>Omobono felt that if he had been a bigger man he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
have boxed the fellow's ears for the impertinent suggestion.
But it was not quite safe, for the man was a big
Venetian gondolier and sailor. Besides, as he went on to
explain, the master had often gone down to the marble
steps at dawn for a plunge and a swim, with nothing
but a sheet round him, coming back to dress in his room.
Perhaps he had done so now, and perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The man stopped short. Perhaps Zeno was drowned.
He looked at Omobono, but the secretary shook his
head, and pointed to the undisturbed couch. Zeno
would certainly not have gone out bathing before going
to bed. Neither of them thought of looking into the
small military trunk which stood in a dark corner, and
from which Zeno had taken the leathern jerkin and stout
hose which he had put on for the expedition.</p>

<p>Omobono had, of course, already questioned the slave-girls.
They told what they knew, that the master had
supped upstairs, and had dismissed them. When they
came back to the room he was gone, they said; and this
was true, since they had slept all night. The Kokóna
was now asleep, they added; but they did not say that
she was sleeping dressed as she had been on the previous
evening, and looked very tired, for that was none of the
secretary's business.</p>

<p>Omobono went up and down the stairs almost as often
that morning as on the day of Zoë's first coming, and again
and again he instructed Yulia to call him when her mistress
awoke. The answer was always the same: the
Kokóna was still asleep, and the secretary should be
called as soon as she rose. At last he began to think that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
she, too, had left the house, and that the girls were in the
secret, and he threatened to go in and see for himself.
To his surprise Yulia stood aside to let him pass, laying
one finger on her lips as a warning to make no noise;
for the little slave saw well enough that he suspected
her of lying, and she was afraid of him in Zeno's absence.
Seeing that she did not oppose him, he was convinced,
and did not go in.</p>

<p>He would not send out messengers to ask for his
master at the houses of the Venetian merchants, or at
their places of business, for he had a true Italian's instinct
to conceal from the outer world everything that
happens in the house. Yet he found himself in a dilemma;
for Zeno had invited Sebastian Polo, his wife
and his daughter, and other friends to dinner, and they
would come, and be amazed to find that he was not there
to receive them. Yet if word were sent to them not to
come, Zeno might return in time and be justly angry;
and then he would call the poor secretary something
worse than a cackling hen. It was a terrible difficulty,
and all the servants and slaves downstairs were chattering
about it like magpies, except when the secretary was just
passing. The cook sent to ask whether he was to prepare
the dinner.</p>

<p>'Certainly,' answered Omobono. 'The master is no
doubt gone out on pressing business, and will be back
in plenty of time to receive his friends.'</p>

<p>He tried to speak calmly, poor man, but he was in a
terrible stew. Anxiety had brought out two round red
spots on his grey cheeks; for once his trim beard was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
almost ruffled, and his small round eyes were haggard
and bloodshot.</p>

<p>As the time for the arrival of the guests drew near,
he felt his brain reeling, and the rooms whirled round
him, till he felt that the universe was going raving mad,
and that he was in the very centre of it. Still Zoë slept,
and still the master did not come.</p>

<p>At last there was but half an hour left. Omobono
strained every nerve he possessed, and determined to
meet the tremendous difficulty in a way that should elicit
Zeno's admiration. He would receive the ladies and
gentlemen as major-duomo, he would make an excuse
for his master, he would instal them in their places at
table, and would direct the service. Of the cook and
the cellar the little man felt quite sure, and that was a
great consolation in his extremity. If he gave Zeno's
friends of the best, and made a polite apology, and saw
that nothing went wrong, it would be impossible to ask
more of him or to suggest that he had failed in his duty.
When the guests were gone he would go to bed and have
an attack of fever; of that he felt quite sure, but then the
terrible ordeal would be over, and it would be a relief
to lie on his back and feel very ill.</p>

<p>He retired and dressed himself in his best clothes.
His cloth hose were of a dark wine colour, but were now
a little loose for his legs. He looked at them affectionately
as he examined them in the light. They recalled
many cheerful hours and some proud moments; they
remembered also the days when his little legs had not
been so thin. Yet by pulling them up almost to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
tearing point they lost in width what they gained in
length, and made a very good appearance after all, for
he secured them by an ingenious contrivance of belt and
string. It was true that when he walked he felt as if
he were being lifted from the floor by the back of his
waistband, but that only made him feel a little taller
than he was, and forced him to hold himself very
straight, which was a distinct advantage.</p>

<p>Now in all this trouble it never occurred to him that
his master was in any great danger or trouble, much
less that he might have been killed in some mad adventure.
Carlo Zeno had lived through such desperate
perils again and again, that Omobono had formed the
habit of believing him to be indestructible, if not invulnerable,
and sure to fall on his feet whatever happened.
The secretary only wished he would not choose to disappear
on the very day when he had asked five friends
to dine with him.</p>

<p>Omobono stood in his fine clean shirt and his wine-coloured
hose, combing and smoothing his beard carefully
with the help of a little mirror no bigger than the
bottom of a tumbler. The glass was indeed so small
that he could only get an impression of his whole face
by moving the thing about, from his chin to his nose,
from one cheek to the other, and from his forehead to his
thin throat, round which he admired the neatly fitting
line of the narrow linen collar. But this last effort
required a good deal of squinting, for the point of his
beard was in the way.</p>

<p>While he was thus engaged some one tapped at his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
door, and a small voice informed him that Kokóna
Arethusa was now awake, and wished to see him instantly.
Though the door was not opened by the
speaker, Omobono hastily laid down his glass and his
comb, and struggled into his tunic as if his life depended
on his getting it on before he answered; for he was a very
modest man, and the voice was a girl's; moreover, he was
aware that the device of belt and strings by which his hose
were drawn up so very tightly must present a ridiculous
appearance until covered by his over-garment; then,
however, the effect would be excellent. So he got on his
tunic as fast as he could, and then answered with the
calmness of perfectly restored dignity through the closed
door.</p>

<p>'Tell the Kokóna that I am at her service,' he said;
'and that I shall be with her immediately.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir,' said the small voice, and he heard the girl's
retreating footsteps immediately after she had spoken.</p>

<p>A few moments later he was going up the stairs as
fast as the tremendous tension of his hose would allow,
and as he went he reflected with satisfaction that as
major-duomo he could not by any possibility be called
upon to sit down in the presence of his master's guests.</p>

<p>One of the slave-girls ushered him into Zoë's presence.
The latter was seated on the edge of the divan, looking
anxiously towards the door when he entered, and for the
first time since she had been in the house he saw her face
uncovered. It was very pale, and there were deep
shadows under her eyes. Her beautiful brown hair was in
wild disorder, too, and fell in a loosened tress upon one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
shoulder. The hand that rested on the edge of the divan
strained upon a fold of the delicate silk carpet that covered
the couch. She spoke as soon as Omobono appeared.</p>

<p>'Have you heard from him?' she asked anxiously.
'Is he coming?'</p>

<p>It did not seem strange to the secretary that she
should already know of Zeno's absence, since no one in
the house could think or talk of anything else. On his
part he was resolved to maintain the calm dignity becoming
to the major-duomo of a noble house.</p>

<p>'The master will doubtless come home when he has
finished the urgent business that called him away,' he
answered. 'In his absence, it will be my duty to make
excuses to his guests&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Are they coming? Have you not sent them word
to stay away?'</p>

<p>Omobono smiled in a sort of superiorly humble way.</p>

<p>'And what if the master should return just at the hour
of dinner?' he asked. 'What would he say if I had ventured
to take upon myself such a responsibility? The
Kokóna does not know the master! Happily I have
been in his service too long not to understand my
duty. If it pleases him to come home, he will find that
his friends have been entertained as he desired. If he
does not come, he will be glad to learn afterwards that
the proper excuses were offered to them for his unavoidable
absence, and that they were treated with the honour
due to their station.'</p>

<p>Zoë stared at the secretary, really amazed by his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
calmness, and almost reassured by his evident belief
in Zeno's safety. It was true that he knew nothing of
the facts, and had not seen his master hanging by the end
of a rope, fifty feet above the ground, within twelve
hours. It would have been hard to imagine Omobono's
state of mind if he had spent the night as Zoë had. But
nevertheless his assurance rested her, and restored a little
of her confidence in Zeno's good fortune. Of his courage
and his strength she needed not to be reminded; but
she knew well enough that unless chance were in his
favour, he could never leave Blachernæ except to die.</p>

<p>'Do you really think he is safe?' Zoë asked, glad to hear
the reassuring words, even in her own voice.</p>

<p>'Of course, Kokóna&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But at this moment the sound of oars in the water,
and of several voices talking together, came up through
the open window from the landing below.</p>

<p>All Omobono's excitement returned at the thought that
he might not get down the stairs in time to receive the
guests at the marble steps just as the boats came alongside.
Without another word he turned and fled precipitately.</p>

<p>Zoë had heard the voices too, and had understood;
and, in spite of her anxiety, a gentle smile at the secretary's
nervousness flitted across her tired face. The
two slave-girls had run to the window to see who was
coming, and as they had always been told not to show
themselves at windows, they crouched down in the balcony
and looked through the open-work of marble which
formed the parapet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span></p>

<p>Zoë rose to cross the room. In the first rush of memory
that came with waking, she had almost forgotten
that she had been hurt, and now she bit her lip as the pain
shot down her right side. But she smiled almost instantly.
She would rather have been hurt unawares
by the man she loved, than that he should not have
touched her at the very moment of going into danger.
The memory of his crushing weight upon her for that
instant was something she would not part with. Women
know what that is. She thought how tenderly he would
have stooped to kiss her, if he had known that she was
lying there under the canvas. Instead, he had stepped
upon her body; and it was almost better than a kiss,
for that would have left nothing of itself; but now each
movement that hurt her brought him close to her again.</p>

<p>She had received no real injury, but she limped as she
walked to the window. Then she stood still just within
it, where she could not see down to the steps below, but
could talk with the slave-girls in a whisper. Doubtless,
since Zeno had not wished her to be seen, she would not
have shown herself; but she was quite conscious that she
looked ill and tired, and by no means fit to face a rival
who had been described to her as fresher than spring
roses; so that the sacrifice was, after all, not so great as it
might have been.</p>

<p>'Tell me what you see,' she said to the maids.</p>

<p>Lucilla turned up her sallow little face.</p>

<p>'There are three,' she answered. 'There is a Venetian
lord, and his lady, and a young lady. At least, I suppose
she is young.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_295" id="i_295"></a>
<img src="images/i_295.jpg" width="373" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">'Tell me what you see,' she said to the maids.</p>
</div>

<p>'I should think you could see that,' Zoë said.</p>

<p>'Her face is veiled,' Lucilla replied, after peering down;
'but I can see her hair. It is red, and she has a great
deal of it.'</p>

<p>'Red like Rustan's wife's hair?' asked Zoë.</p>

<p>'Oh no! It is red like a lady's; for it is well dyed
with the good khenna that comes from Alexandria.
Now they are getting out&mdash;the old lady first&mdash;she is
fat&mdash;the secretary and her husband help her on each
side. She is all wrapped in a long green silk mantle
embroidered with red roses. She is like a dish of spinach
in flames. How fat she is!'</p>

<p>Lucilla shook a little, as if she were laughing internally.</p>

<p>'What does her daughter wear?' asked Zoë.</p>

<p>'A dark purple cloak, with a broad silver trimming.'</p>

<p>'How hideous!' exclaimed Zoë, for no particular
reason.</p>

<p>'The secretary bows to the ground,' Lucilla said. 'He
is saying something.'</p>

<p>She stopped speaking, and all three listened. Zoë
could hear Omobono's voice quite distinctly.</p>

<p>'By a most unfortunate circumstance,' he was saying,
'Messer Carlo Zeno was obliged to go out on very urgent
business, and has not yet returned. I am his secretary
and major-duomo, as your lordship may deign to remember.
In my master's absence I have the honour to welcome
his guests, and to wait upon them.'</p>

<p>Sebastian Polo said something in answer to this fine
speech; but in a low tone, and Zoë could not hear the
words. Then a peculiarly disagreeable woman's voice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
asked a question. Zoë thought it sounded like something
between the croaking of many frogs and the clucking
of an old hen. 'We hope you will give us our dinner,
whatever happens,' said the lady, who seemed to be of a
practical turn of mind.</p>

<p>'Is that the girl's voice?' asked Zoë of Lucilla, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>The maid shook her head.</p>

<p>'The mother,' she answered. 'Now they are going in.
I cannot hear what Omobono says, for he is leading the
way. They are all gone.'</p>

<p>Zoë did not care who else came, and now that the
moment was over she was much less disturbed by the fact
that Giustina was under the same roof with her than she
had expected to be. She did not believe that Zeno had
ever kissed Giustina, and he had certainly never stepped
on her.</p>

<p>She let her maids do what they would with her now,
hardly noticing the skill they showed in helping her to
move, and in smoothing away the pain she felt, as only
the people of the East know how to do it. As she did
not speak to them they dared not ask her questions about
the master's absence. They had left him with her when
they had been sent away; they had slept till morning;
when they awoke they had found Zoë lying on the divan
asleep in her clothes, and the master had gone out of the
house unseen and had not returned. That was as far
as their knowledge went; but they were sure that she
knew everything, and they hoped that if they pleased her
even more than usual she would let fall some words of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
explanation, as mistresses sometimes do when their servants
are particularly satisfactory. Most young women,
when they are in a good humour, let their maids know
what they have been doing; and as soon as they are
cross the maids revenge themselves by telling the other
servants everything. In this way the balance of power
is maintained between the employer and the employed,
like the hydrostatic equilibrium in the human body,
which cannot be destroyed without bringing on a
syncope.</p>

<p>But though Zoë felt very much less pain after Yulia
and Lucilla had bathed her and rubbed her, and had
gently pulled at all her joints till she felt supple and light
again, she said nothing about Zeno; and though they
dressed her so skilfully that she could not help smiling
with pleasure when they showed her to herself in the
large mirror they held up between them, yet she only
thanked them kindly, and gave them each two spoonfuls
of roseleaf preserve, which represented to them an
almost heavenly delight, as she well knew, and which she
herself did not at all despise. That was all, however;
and they were a little disappointed, because she did not
condescend to talk to them about the master's disappearance,
which was the greatest event that had happened
since they had all three lived under Zeno's roof.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Omobono was playing his part of major-duomo
downstairs, and had installed the guests at the
table set for them in the large hall looking over the
Golden Horn. After Polo and his wife, another Venetian
merchant had arrived, the rich old banker Marin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Cornèr, long established in Constantinople, and a friend
of Sebastian Polo. The fifth person invited did not
appear, so that two seats were vacant, the sixth being
Zeno's own; and behind his high carved chair Omobono
installed himself, to direct the servants, quite an
imposing figure in his dark purple tunic and the handsome
silver chain, which he had put on to-day to indicate
his high office in the establishment. Poor
Omobono! He little dreamt of what was in store for
him that day.</p>

<p>The three older guests were moderately sorry that
Zeno was not present. In their several ways they were
all a little afraid of their eccentric countryman, about
whom the most wild tales were told. Though in truth
he was extremely punctual in meeting his financial
engagements, both Sebastian Polo and Marin Cornèr
had always felt a little nervous about doing business
with a young man who was known to have kept an
army at bay for a whole winter, who was reported to have
slain at least a hundred Turks with his own hand, and
whose brown eyes gleamed like a tiger's at the mere
mention of a fight. It would be so extremely awkward
if, instead of meeting a bill that fell due, he should appear
at Cornèr's bank armed to the teeth and demand
the contents of the strong box. On the whole the two
elderly merchants ate with a better appetite in his
absence.</p>

<p>But Giustina was inconsolable, and the good things
did not appeal to her, neither the fresh sturgeon's
roe from the Black Sea, nor the noble palamit, nor the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
delicate quails, nor even the roasted peacock, whose
magnificent tail rose out of a vast silver dish like a rainbow
with spots on it.</p>

<p>She was a big, sleepy creature with quantities of
handsomely dyed hair, as Lucilla had told Zoë. She
had large and regular features, a perfectly colourless
white skin, and a discontented mouth. She often turned
her eyes to see what was going on, without turning her
head at all, as if she were too lazy to make even that
small effort. Her hands were well shaped, but heavy
in the fingers, and they looked like new marble, too
white to be interesting, too cold to touch.</p>

<p>She was terribly disappointed and deeply offended
by what seemed to her a deliberate insult; for she did
not believe a word of Omobono's polite apology. The
truth was that Zeno had only invited the party because
her mother had invited herself in the hope of bringing
him to the point of offering to marry Giustina. As a
matter of fact nothing had ever been farther from his
thoughts. Sebastian Polo, urged by his wife, had
entered into the closest relations of business with Zeno,
and had again and again given him a share in transactions
that had been extraordinarily profitable. He had
rendered it necessary for Zeno to see him often, and had
made it easy by his constant hospitality; in these things
lay the whole secret of Zeno's visits to his house. But
seeing that matters did not take a matrimonial direction
as quickly as she had expected, Polo's wife had adopted
a course which she intended to make decisive; she had
asked herself and her daughter to dine with Zeno.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
From this to hinting that he had compromised Giustina,
and thence to extracting an offer of marriage, would be
easy steps, familiar to every enterprising mother, since
the beginning of the matrimonial ages. And that was a
long time ago&mdash;even before Solomon's day, when the
horseleech's two daughters cried, 'Give, give!' Zeno's
value as a possible husband lay less in his fortune than
in his very magnificent connections at home, and in the
fact that the Emperor Charles had been his godfather and
afterwards his friend and patron.</p>

<p>Giustina understood her thoughtful parent's policy;
she was therefore unhappy, and would eat no peacock,
a circumstance which greatly distressed Omobono.
Happily for him, the young woman's abstention was
fully compensated by the readiness of the elder guests
to partake of what she obstinately refused, even to
something like repletion.</p>

<p>While they ate, they talked; that is to say, Sebastian
Polo and Marin Cornèr compared opinions on business
matters such as the value of Persian silks, Greek wines,
and white slaves, without giving away to each other the
least thread of information that could be turned into
money. And Polo's wife, who had an eye to the main
chance, croaked a few words now and then, encouraging
Cornèr to talk more freely of his affairs; perhaps,
thought she, he might betray the secret of his wonderful
success in obtaining from the Caucasus certain priceless
furs which no merchant but he had ever been able to
get. But though the fat dame lured him on to talk and
made signs to have his glass filled again and again with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
Chian wine, and though the colours of a most beautiful
sunset began to creep up his thin nose and his high
cheek bones, as the rich evening light climbs in the
western sky, Marin Cornèr's speech was as quiet and
clear as ever, and what he said was, if anything, a trifle
more cautious than before.</p>

<p>And meanwhile Giustina stared across her empty
plate at the boats on the Golden Horn, and nursed her
wrath against the man she wished to marry.</p>

<p>'My child,' croaked her mother, 'we fully understand
your disappointment. But you should make an effort
to be cheerful, if only for the sake of Messer Marin Cornèr,
your father's valued friend.'</p>

<p>'I beg you to excuse my dulness, Madam,' answered
the daughter dutifully, and with all the ceremony that
children were taught to use in addressing their parents.
'I shall endeavour to obey you.'</p>

<p>'Come, come, Donna Giustina!' cried Cornèr. 'We
will drink your health and happiness in this good&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The sentence remained unfinished, and his lips did
not close; as he set down the untasted wine, his eyes
fixed themselves on a point between Omobono and Polo,
and the sunset effects faded from his nose, leaving a grey
twilight behind.</p>

<p>The fat dame thought it was an apoplexy, and half
rose from her seat; but Giustina's eyes followed the
direction of his look and she uttered a cry of real fear.
Sebastian Polo, who sat with his back to the sight that
terrified his daughter, gazed at the other three in astonishment.
But Omobono turned half round and gasped, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
seized the back of Zeno's empty chair, swinging it round
on one of its legs till it was between him and the vision.</p>

<p>Tocktamish stood there, grinning at the assembled
company in a way to terrify the stoutest heart amongst
them. He was magnificently arrayed in his full dress
uniform of flaming yellow and gold, and his huge round
fur papakh was set well back on his shaggy head. His
right hand toyed amidst a perfect arsenal of weapons in
his belt, and his blood-shot eyes rolled frightfully as he
looked from one guest to the other, showing his shark's
teeth as he grinned and grinned again.</p>

<p>It was certainly Tocktamish, the Tartar; and Tocktamish
was not perfectly sober. He was the more pleased
by the impression his appearance had produced. He
at once came forward to the empty place of the absent
guest, which was next to Giustina's.</p>

<p>'I see that you have kept a place for me,' he said in
barbarous Greek. 'That was very kind of you! And
I am in time for the peacock, too!'</p>

<p>Thereupon he sat down in the chair, looked round the
table, and grinned again.</p>

<p>The fat lady collapsed in a fainting fit, the two elderly
merchants edged away from the board as far as they
could, and Giustina uttered another piercing shriek when
the Tartar leered at her.</p>

<p>'Who is this person?' her father tried to ask with
dignity, meaning the question for Omobono.</p>

<p>But Omobono had vanished, and the servants had
fled after him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p>Tocktamish poured half a flagon of Chian wine into
a tall Venetian beaker and drank it off by way of whetting
his appetite.</p>

<p>'The master of the house is unavoidably absent,' he
observed, when he had smacked his lips noisily. 'He has
sent me to beg that you will excuse him and make yourselves
at home.'</p>

<p>By this time Dame Polo was beginning to revive, and
the two men were somewhat reassured as to the Tartar's
intentions. When he had entered he had looked as if
he meant to murder them all, but it was now evident
from his manner that he wished to produce a pleasant
impression. He drew the peacock towards him, and at
once took all the best pieces that were left on the dish,
using his fingers to save trouble. Giustina watched him
without turning her head, and judged that, after all,
he had only meant to show his admiration for her beauty
when he had leered so horribly. She was in reality
the least timid of all the party, though she had shrieked
so loudly, and she remembered a fairy story about a
frightful monster that had loved a beautiful princess.
She was already pondering on the means of making a
similar conquest.</p>

<p>'Are we to understand,' asked Marin Cornèr, politely,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
but in a shaky tone, 'that you come from Messer Carlo
Zeno?'</p>

<p>Tocktamish grunted assent, for his mouth was full,
and he nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>'Messer Carlo Zeno is in need of a large sum of money
without delay,' he said, when he was able to speak again.</p>

<p>Sebastian Polo looked at Marin Cornèr significantly;
and Marin Cornèr looked at Sebastian Polo. The fat
lady pricked her ears, figuratively speaking, for indeed
they were much too deeply embedded in their exuberant
surroundings of cheek and jowl to suggest that they could
ever prick at all. The Tartar crammed his mouth full
again, and his great beard wagged with his jaws in the
inevitable silence that followed. In her heart Giustina
compared him to a ravenous lion, but her father thought
he resembled a hungry hyena.</p>

<p>Finding that his throat was not cut yet, and learning
that there was to be a question of money, Marin Cornèr
felt that the colour was returning to his nose and the
warmth to his heart.</p>

<p>'Why does Messer Carlo not come home himself and get
the money he needs?' he asked.</p>

<p>By this time Omobono had recovered from his fright
enough to creep into the room behind Tocktamish. He
was already making anxious gestures to the two Venetian
gentlemen to enjoin caution. The Tartar drank again
before he answered the question.</p>

<p>'He happened to be so busy that he preferred to send
me to get the money for him,' said the soldier. 'You
see we are old friends. We fought together in Greece.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span></p>

<p>Then Omobono's voice was heard, quavering with
anxiety.</p>

<p>'There is no money in the house!' he cried, winking
violently at Polo and Cornèr. 'There is not a penny, I
swear! There were large payments to make yesterday.'</p>

<p>The poor little secretary was so anxious to be heard
that he had come within arm's length of the Tartar,
though behind him. Tocktamish turned his big head,
and put out his hand unexpectedly, and Omobono felt
himself caught and whirled round like a child till he was
close to the table and face to face with the tipsy giant.
He was sure that he felt his liver shrivelling up inside
him with sheer fright.</p>

<p>'What is this little animal?' the Tartar asked, cocking
one eye in a knowing way and examining him with a sort
of boozy gravity.</p>

<p>But Omobono really could not find a word. His captor
shook him playfully.</p>

<p>'What is your name, you funny little beast?' he enquired,
and he roared with laughter by way of answering
himself.</p>

<p>Giustina, strange to say, was the only one to join in his
mirth, and she laughed quite prettily, to the inexpressible
surprise of her parents, who were shocked and grieved,
as well as scared almost to death.</p>

<p>'Come, come!' laughed the Tartar, shaking the little
man like a bean-bag. 'If you cannot speak, you can at
least give up your keys, and I will see for myself if there
is any money!'</p>

<p>Thereupon he seized the bunch of keys which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
secretary wore at his belt, and wrenched it off with a pull
that snapped the thong by which it hung. Again
Giustina laughed, but a little more nervously now; her
mother sat transfixed, open-mouthed, with an almost
idiotic expression. Again the two merchants glanced
at each other, and then both looked towards the
door.</p>

<p>Between his fright and the terrible indignity of having
his keys torn from him, Omobono had never been nearer
to fainting in his life.</p>

<p>'Robbery!' he gasped. 'Rank robbery!'</p>

<p>Tocktamish sent him spinning into the nearest corner
by a turn of the wrist, after which the ruffian took another
mouthful of meat, and slowly filled his glass while
he was disposing of it. Omobono had steadied himself
in the corner, but his face was deadly white, and his lips
were moving nervously in a delirium of terror.</p>

<p>'Messer Carlo needs ten thousand ducats before sunset,'
observed the Tartar before he drank.</p>

<p>Polo and Cornèr started to their feet; to their commercial
souls the mere mention of such a demand was
more terrifying than all the crooked weapons that
gleamed in Tocktamish's broad belt.</p>

<p>'Ten thousand ducats!' they repeated together
in a breath.</p>

<p>'Yes!' roared the Tartar, in a voice that made the
glasses on the table shake together and ring. 'Ten
thousand ducats! And if I do not find the money in
the house, you two must find it in yours! Do you
understand?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_309" id="i_309"></a>
<img src="images/i_309.jpg" width="550" height="403" alt="" />
<p class="caption">'Yes!' roared the Tartar. 'Ten thousand ducats! And if I do not find the money in the house, you two must
find it in yours! Do you understand?'</p>
</div>

<p>They understood, for his voice was like thunder,
and he had risen too, and towered above them with his
full glass in one hand and Omobono's keys in the other.
Then, being already tolerably drunk, he solemnly raised
the keys to his lips, thinking that he held the glass in
that hand, and rolled his eyes terribly at the two merchants;
and he set the glass down with an emphatic
gesture, as if it had been the bunch of keys, and it broke
to pieces, and the yellow wine splashed out across the
table and ran down and streamed upon the mosaic
floor.</p>

<p>A terrific Tartar oath announced that he had realised
his mistake, and as he at once made up his mind that the
Venetians were responsible for it, his next action was to
hurl the foot of the broken glass at Polo's head; and he
instantly seized the empty silver flagon and flung it at
Cornèr's face. The lighter weapon missed its aim and
broke to atoms against the opposite wall, but the jug
struck Cornèr full on the bridge of his thin nose with
awful effect, and he fell to the floor and lay there, a
moaning, bleeding heap.</p>

<p>Polo looked neither at his wife nor at his daughter,
but fled through the open door at the top of his not very
great speed. His wife fainted outright, and in real
earnest now, and with a final croak rolled gently from
her chair, without hurting herself at all. Omobono
flattened his lean body against the wall, trembling in
every joint, and gibbering with fear; and Tocktamish,
seeing that he had so satisfactorily cleared the field, proceeded
to address his attentions to Giustina, who had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
not fainted, but was really much too frightened to rise
from her seat or try to escape.</p>

<p>The Tartar drew his chair nearer to hers, and suddenly
smiled, as if he had done nothing unusual, and was
only anxious to make himself agreeable. He had been
drinking since early morning, but he would be good for at
least another gallon of wine before it made him senseless.
He addressed Giustina in the poetic language of his
native country.</p>

<p>'Come, pet parrot of my soul!' he began, coaxingly.
'Fill me a cup and let me hear your ravishing voice!
Tocktamish has cleared the house as the thunderstorm
clears the hot air from the valley! Drink, my pretty
nightingale, and the golden wine shall warm your speech
in your little throat, as the morning sunshine melts the
icicles in my beard when I have been hunting all night
in winter! Drink, my fawn, my spring lamb, my soft
wood-pigeon, my white bunny rabbit! Drink, sweet
one!'</p>

<p>The Tartar's similes were in hopeless confusion,
possibly because he translated them into Greek, but he
was convinced that he was eloquent, and he was undeniably
as strong as a bear. He had filled a fresh glass and
was evidently anxious to make Giustina drink out of it
before him, for he held it to her lips with his left hand
while his right tried to take her round the waist and draw
her to his knee.</p>

<p>But this was much more than she was prepared to
submit to. In the fairy story, Beast was less enterprising
in the presence of Beauty, and collapsed into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
obedience at the mere lifting of her finger. Giustina
was a big creature, usually sleepy and not inclined to
move quickly; but she was capable of exerting considerable
strength in an emergency. The instant she felt
Tocktamish's hand at her waist, she rose with a quick,
serpentine motion that unwound her, as it were, from
his encircling hold, and almost before he knew that she
was on her feet she had fled from the room and slammed
the door behind her.</p>

<p>Tocktamish tried to follow her, but he stumbled
successively over the still unconscious dame and the still
moaning Cornèr, so that when he reached the door at
last his purpose had undergone a change, and, as he
thought, an improvement. Women never ran out of the
house into the street, he argued; therefore Giustina
was now upstairs and would stay there; hence it would
be wiser to finish the peacock and anything else he could
lay hands on before going to pay her a visit. For Tocktamish
found the food and the wine to his liking, and
such as were not to be had every day, even by a Tartar
officer with plenty of money in his wallet. He was
tolerably steady still, as he made his way back towards
his seat.</p>

<p>His eye fell on Omobono, flattened against the wall
and still in a palsy of fear; for all that has been told since
Cornèr had fallen and Polo had run away had occupied
barely two minutes.</p>

<p>Tocktamish suddenly felt lonely, and the little secretary
amused him. He took him by the collar and
whirled him into Giustina's vacant chair at the table.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<p>'You may keep me company, while I finish my
dinner,' he explained. 'I cannot eat alone&mdash;it disturbs
my digestion.'</p>

<p>He roared with laughter, and slapped Omobono
on the back playfully. The little man felt as if he had
been struck between the shoulders by a large ham, and
the breath was almost knocked out of his body; and he
wondered how in the world his tight hose had survived
the strain of his sitting down so suddenly.</p>

<p>'You look starved,' observed the Tartar, in a tone of
concern, after observing his face attentively. 'What
you want is food and drink, man!'</p>

<p>With a sudden impulse of hospitality he began to heap
up food on Giustina's unused plate, with a fine indifference
to gastronomy, or possibly with a tipsy sense of
humour. He piled up bits of roast peacock, little salt
fish, olives, salad, raisins, dried figs, candied strawberries,
and honey cake, till he could put no more on the plate,
which he then set before Omobono.</p>

<p>'Eat that,' he said. 'It will do you good.'</p>

<p>Then he addressed himself to the peacock again, with
a good will.</p>

<p>Omobono would have got up and slipped away,
if he had dared. Next to his bodily fear, he was oppressed
by the terrible impropriety of sitting at his
master's table, where the guests should have been.
This seemed to him a dreadful thing.</p>

<p>'Really, sir,' he began, 'if you will allow me I would
rather&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Do not talk. Eat!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>Tocktamish set the example by tearing the meat off
a peacock's leg with his teeth.</p>

<p>'You need it,' he added, with his mouth very full.</p>

<p>The poor secretary looked at the curiously mixed mess
which his tormentor had set before him, and he felt very
uncomfortable at the mere idea of tasting the stuff.
Then he glanced at the Tartar and saw the latter's
bloodshot eye rolling at him hideously, while the shark-like
teeth picked a leg bone, and terror chilled his heart
again. What would happen if he refused to eat?
Tocktamish dropped the bone and filled two glasses.</p>

<p>'To Messer Carlo Zeno!' he cried, setting the wine to his
lips.</p>

<p>Omobono thought a little wine might steady his
nerves; and, moreover, he could not well refuse to drink
his master's health.</p>

<p>'Good!' laughed Tocktamish. 'If you cannot eat,
you can drink!'</p>

<p>Just then Cornèr groaned piteously, where he lay in a
heap on the floor. His nose was much hurt, but he was
even more badly frightened. The Tartar was not
pleased.</p>

<p>'If that man is dead, take him out and bury him!'
he cried, turning on Omobono. 'If he is alive, kick him
and tell him to hold his tongue! He disturbs us at our
dinner.'</p>

<p>Omobono thought he saw a chance of escaping,
and rose, as if to obey. But the Tartar's long arm
reached him instantly and he was forced back into his
seat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span></p>

<p>'I thought you meant me to take him away,' he feebly
explained.</p>

<p>'I was speaking to the slaves,' said Tocktamish gravely,
though there was no servant or slave within hearing.</p>

<p>The unfortunate merchant, who was not at all unconscious,
and had probably groaned with a vague idea
of exciting compassion, now held his peace, for he did
not desire to be kicked, still less to be taken out and
buried. The Tartar seemed satisfied by the silence that
followed. After another glass he rose to his feet and took
Omobono by the arm; considering his potations he was
still wonderfully steady on his legs.</p>

<p>'Where is the strong box?' he asked, dragging the
secretary towards the door opposite to the one through
which Giustina had gone out.</p>

<p>'There is no money in the house,' cried Omobono, in
renewed terror. 'I swear to you that there is no money!'</p>

<p>'Very well,' answered the Tartar, who had taken
the keys from the table. 'Show me the empty box.'</p>

<p>'There is no strong box, sir,' answered the secretary,
resolving to control his fear and die in defending his
master's property.</p>

<p>The difficulty was to carry out this noble resolution.
Tocktamish grabbed him by both arms and held him in
the vice of his grasp.</p>

<p>'Little man,' he said gravely. 'There is a box,
and I will find the box, and I will put you into the box,
and I will throw the box into the water. Then you will
know that it is not good to lie to Tocktamish. Now
show me where it is.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>Omobono shrank to something like half his natural
size in his shame and fear, and led the way to the counting-house.
Once only he stopped, and made a gallant
attempt to be brave, and tried to repeat his queer little
prayer, as he did on all the great occasions of his life.</p>

<p>'O Lord, grant wealth and honour to the Most Serene
Republic,' he began, and though he realised that in his
present situation this request was not much to the point,
he would have gone on to ask for victory over the Genoese,
on general principles.</p>

<p>But at that moment he felt something as sharp as a
pin sticking into him just where his hose would naturally
have been most tight, and where, in fact, the strain that
pulled them up was most severe; in that part of the
human body, in short, which, as most of us have known
since childhood is peculiarly sensitive to pain. There
was no answer to such an argument <i>a posteriori</i>; the
little man's head went down, his shoulders went up, and
he trotted on; and though he could not be put off from
finishing his prayer he had reached the door of the counting-house
when he was only just beginning to pray that
he might have strength to resist curiosity, a request even
more out of place, just then, than a petition for the destruction
of the Genoese. A moment later he and Tocktamish
entered the room, and the Tartar shut the door
behind him.</p>

<p>Neither of the two had heard two little bare feet
following them softly at a distance; but when the door
was shut Lucilla ran nimbly up to it and quickly drew
the great old iron bolt which had been left where it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
once been useful, at a time when the disposition of the
house had been different. Lucilla knew that all the
windows within had heavy gratings, and that neither
Omobono nor his captor could get out.</p>

<p>Giustina had fled upstairs, as women generally do
to save themselves from any immediate danger. They
are born with the idea that when a house has more than
one story the upper one is set apart for them and their
children, as indeed it always was in the Middle Ages, and
they feel sure that there must be other women there who
will help them, or defend them, or hide them. For it
is a curious fact that whereas women distrust each other
profoundly where the one man of their affections is concerned,
they rely on each other as a whole body, banded
together to resist and get the better of the male sex, in a
way that would do credit to any army in an enemy's
country. Therefore Giustina went upstairs, quite certain
of finding other women.</p>

<p>Now there was but one door on the upper landing,
and that was Zoë's, and it was open; and just outside
it Lucilla was hiding in the curtain, listening to the
strange sounds that came up from below; but when
Giustina ran in without seeing her, the little slave
stayed outside and slipped downstairs noiselessly, listened
again at the dining-room door, watched the Tartar
and the secretary from a place of safety, and then ran
nimbly after them on purpose to lock them in, as she did,
for she was a clever little slave and remembered the bolt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Giustina rushed on like a whirlwind till
she fell panting on the divan beside Zoë, hardly seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
her at all, and staring at the door, through which she
expected every moment to see the burly Tartar enter in
pursuit; so that Yulia, who guessed the danger, ran and
shut it of her own accord.</p>

<p>Then Giustina drew a long breath and looked round,
and she met Zoë's eyes scrutinising her face with a look
she never forgot.</p>

<p>'That monster!' she exclaimed, by way of explanation
and apology.</p>

<p>Zoë had heard nothing, for the house was solidly built,
and she had not the least idea who had frightened
Giustina. It occurred to her that Gorlias might be in
the house, and that on being seen by the Venetians it had
suited him to terrify them in order to get out again
without being questioned.</p>

<p>'You are Giustina Polo,' she said. 'I am Arethusa,
Messer Carlo Zeno's slave. Will you tell me what has
happened?'</p>

<p>Giustina had now recovered herself enough to see
that this Arethusa was very lovely, and she momentarily
forgot the danger she had escaped.</p>

<p>'You are his slave!' she repeated slowly, and still
breathing hard. 'Ah&mdash;I begin to understand.'</p>

<p>'So do I,' Zoë answered, looking at the handsome,
heavy face, the dyed hair, and marble hands.</p>

<p>There was something like relief in her tone, now that
she had examined her rival well.</p>

<p>'When did Carlo buy you?' asked Giustina, growing
coldly insolent as she recovered her breath and realised
her social superiority.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>'I think it was just five weeks ago,' Zoë answered
simply. 'But it seems as if I had always been here.'</p>

<p>'I have no doubt,' said Giustina. 'Five weeks!
Yes, I understand now.'</p>

<p>Then a fancied sound waked her fear of pursuit again,
and her eyes turned quickly towards the door. Yulia
was standing beside it, listening with her ear to the crack;
she shook her head as she met Giustina's anxious glance.
There was nothing; no one was coming.</p>

<p>'You had better tell me what has happened,' Zoë
said. 'You met some one who frightened you,' she
suggested.</p>

<p>Giustina saw that Zoë was in complete ignorance of the
Tartar's visit, and she told what she had seen and heard
downstairs. As she went on, explaining that Tocktamish
demanded ten thousand ducats in Zeno's name,
Zoë's expression grew more anxious, for she gathered the
truth from the broken and exaggerated narrative. After
failing in his attempt to free Johannes, Zeno had fallen
into the hands of the soldiers he had won over to the
revolution; they demanded an enormous ransom, and
if it was not forthcoming they would give him up to
Andronicus.</p>

<p>It was bad enough, yet it was better than it might
have been, for it meant that Zeno was still alive and safe,
and would not be hurt so long as his captors could be
made to wait for the money they asked.</p>

<p>'Ten thousand ducats!' Zoë repeated. 'It is more
than can ever be got together!'</p>

<p>'My father could pay twice as much if he pleased,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
answered the rich merchant's daughter, vain of his
immense wealth. 'But I hardly think he will give anything,'
she added slowly, while she watched Zoë's face
to see what effect the statement might have.</p>

<p>'Messer Carlo has many friends,' Zoë answered
quietly. 'But if he is alive it is very probable that he
may come home without paying any ransom at all.
And if he does, he will certainly repay the soldiers for
the trick they have played him.'</p>

<p>'You do not seem anxious about him,' said Giustina,
deceived and surprised by her assumed calmness.</p>

<p>'Are you?' Zoë asked.</p>

<p>At that moment Yulia opened the door, for she had
been listening from within and had heard her companion's
bare feet on the pavement outside. Lucilla slipped
in, almost dancing with delight at her last feat, and
looking like a queer little sprite escaped from a fairy
tale.</p>

<p>'I have locked them up in the counting-house, Kokóna!'
she cried. 'The Tartar giant and the secretary!
They are quite safe!'</p>

<p>She laughed gleefully and Yulia laughed too. Giustina
suddenly recollected her mother, who had fainted in
the dining-room. As for her father, her knowledge of
his character told her that since there had been danger
he was certainly in a place of safety. She did not care
what became of Marin Cornèr, whom she detested because
he had once dared to ask for her hand, though he
was a widower of fifty. But her mother was entitled
to some consideration after all, if only for having brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
into the world such a wonderful creature as Giustina
really believed herself to be. Yet in her heart the
young woman felt a secret resentment against her for
having grown so enormously fat; since it very often happens
that as daughters grow older they grow more and
more like their mothers, and Giustina was aware that she
herself was already rather heavy for her age. It would
be a terrible thing to be a fat woman at thirty, and it
would be her mother's fault if she were. Many daughters
are familiar with this argument, though they may cry
out and rail at the story-teller in the bazaar who has
betrayed it to the young men.</p>

<p>Giustina rose with much dignity now that she was
fully reassured as to the safety of the house. Zoë was
questioning Lucilla, who could hardly answer without
breaking into laughter at the idea of having imprisoned
Omobono and the terrible Tartar. The little secretary
had never been unkind to any one in his life, but once or
twice, when the master had been out and he had been on
his dignity, he had found the slave-girls loitering on the
stairs and had threatened them with the master's displeasure
and with a consequent condign punishment
if they were ever again caught doing nothing outside their
mistress's apartment; and it was therefore delightful
to know that he was shut up with Tocktamish, in terror
of his life, and that his tremendous dignity was all gone
to pieces in his fright.</p>

<p>'You are a clever girl,' said Zoë. 'I only hope the
door is strong.'</p>

<p>'I called the servants and the slaves before I came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
upstairs,' Lucilla answered. 'I left them piling up
furniture against the door. A giant could not get out
now.'</p>

<p>'Poor Omobono!' Zoë exclaimed. 'How frightened
he must be.'</p>

<p>Giustina meanwhile prepared to go away, settling
and smoothing the folds of her gown, and pressing her
hair on one side and the other. Yulia brought her a
mirror and held it up, and watched the young lady's
complacent smile as she looked at her own reflection.
When she had finished she barely nodded to Zoë, as she
might have done to a slave who had served her, and she
went out in an exceedingly stately and leisurely manner,
quite sure that she had impressed Zoë with her immeasurable
superiority. She was much surprised and
displeased because Zoë did not rise and remain respectfully
standing while she went out, and she promised
herself to remember this also against the beautiful
favourite when she herself should be Carlo Zeno's
wife.</p>

<p>But at a sign from Zoë, Lucilla followed her downstairs
since there was no one else to escort her; and a
few minutes later Yulia saw the little party come out
upon the landing below. The fat lady in green silk
was in a very limp condition, the embroidered roses
seemed to droop and wither, and she was helped by three
of Zeno's men; Marin Cornèr was holding a large napkin
to his injured nose, so that he could not see where he
put his feet and had to be helped by the door porter.
As for Sebastian Polo, his wife and daughter well knew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
that he was by this time safe at home, and was probably
recovering his lost courage by beating his slaves.</p>

<p>'They are gone,' said Yulia, when the boat had shoved
off at last.</p>

<p>Zoë rose then, and went slowly to the window. She
stood there a few moments looking after the skiff, and in
spite of her deep anxiety a faint smile played round her
tender mouth as she thought of her meeting with Giustina;
but it vanished almost at once. Her own situation was
critical and perhaps dangerous.</p>

<p>She knew that although she was a slave she was the
only person in the house who could exercise any authority
now that Omobono was locked up in the counting-house,
and that it would be impossible to let him out
without liberating Tocktamish at the same time, which
was not to be thought of. If the Tartar got out now he
would probably murder the first person he met, and every
one else whom he found in his way; indeed, Zoë thought
it not impossible that he was already murdering Omobono
out of sheer rage.</p>

<p>'Come,' she said to Lucilla. 'We must go downstairs
and see what can be done.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p>Neither Tocktamish nor his victim knew that Lucilla
had slipped the bolt after them, for Omobono was too
terrified to hear anything but the Tartar's voice, and the
latter was just in that state of intoxication in which a
man perceives nothing that is not closely connected
with the idea that possesses him for the time being; it is
a state of mind familiar to those whose business it is to
catch men, or to cheat them.</p>

<p>The strong box stood against the wall at the farther
end of the room, and close to the high desk at which
Omobono usually worked. When he came to it the
secretary stood still, and Tocktamish bent down and
began to fumble with the keys.</p>

<p>The box had three locks, each having a hasp that
closed with a strong spring when the lid was shut down,
and each requiring a separate key. It was a large chest,
completely covered with sheet-iron and heavily bound
with iron straps, the whole being kept bright by daily
polishing.</p>

<p>Tocktamish could not make the keys fit, and desisted
with an oath.</p>

<p>'Open it!' he commanded, seizing the trembling
secretary by the collar and forcing him to his knees
before the chest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span></p>

<p>It would have been death to disobey, in the Tartar's
present mood. Omobono put each key into the lock
to which it belonged, turned each three times, and the
middle one a fourth time, which had the effect of drawing
back all the springs at once; at the same time he raised
the heavy lid a little with one hand, and then opened
it with both.</p>

<p>Tocktamish began to throw the contents out on the
floor with eager haste, seizing upon the money-bags
first; but these were not many, nor were they very
heavy, for the young merchant's capital was invested
in many enterprises and was rarely lying idle, and as for
spare cash he had taken out a goodly sum within the past
two days to be given away to the guards at the palace.
The Tartar soon saw that there were not a thousand gold
ducats in the chest, and there was but a little silver.
The rest of the contents consisted of accounts, papers,
and parchments, many of which represented wealth,
but could not be turned into gold by a thief. Tocktamish
had an ignorant barbarian's primitive idea of
riches, and being profoundly disappointed he at once
became furiously angry.</p>

<p>'Where is the treasure?' he roared, and his face grew
purple.</p>

<p>He shook Omobono like a rat, as he repeated his
question again and again. The wretched secretary
felt that his hour was indeed come, and though he tried
to speak and protest he really made no sound. Then
Tocktamish remembered his own words.</p>

<p>'I said I would drown you in the box!' he cried.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
'And by the sun and moon, full and new, I will! I will,
by the vine, the wine, and the drinkers, you rat, you
miserable Italian flea, you skinny little bag of bones!'</p>

<p>Thereupon he hove up Omobono sideways by one arm
and one leg and dropped him, fainting, into the empty
money-chest, of which he instantly shut the lid. It
closed with a loud snap as the three springs simultaneously
fell into the slots in the three hasps. At the
same moment Omobono lost consciousness; his last
impression had been that he was killed and was to wake
up in purgatory, and he had made one wild attempt to
say a prayer when Tocktamish whirled him off his feet,
but he could only remember the last words&mdash;</p>

<p>'... strength to resist curiosity.'</p>

<p>Then everything was dark, the big locks snapped
above his head and he knew nothing more. Having
successfully accomplished this brave feat, the tipsy
giant gravely sat down on the chest to think, for he had
already forgotten that he had meant to throw it into the
Golden Horn, and besides, even in his condition, he knew
very well that four men could hardly have moved such a
weight. As he sat he stooped down and drew the
scattered contents of the chest towards him, and picked
the small bags from the heaps of documents. Then it
occurred to him that it would be more convenient to put
all the coin into one sack which he could fasten to his
belt. It would not be a very heavy weight, and it
was not possible to cram all the bags into his wallet.
A thousand gold ducats only weighed about twenty
pounds, by goldsmiths' weight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span></p>

<p>When he had put all together in a soft leathern sack
which he found empty, he got upon his feet, with the
idea of going back to rifle the house since he had not found
what he expected in the safe. It was familiar work to
him, for after he had left Greece he had been a robber
before he had turned respectable by taking service with
the Emperor. He kicked the strong box before he went
away.</p>

<p>'Good-bye, little man!' he laughed.</p>

<p>But there was no answer, and at the idea that Omobono
was such a fragile creature as to have died of
fright, he laughed louder and slapped his huge thigh
with his hand. It seemed quite inexpressibly funny to
him that any one should actually die of fear, of all disorders
in the world.</p>

<p>He had fastened the leathern sack securely to his
belt, and he went to the door to let himself out. When
he found it fastened he looked at it curiously, and
scratched his big head, trying to remember whether he
had locked it after him or not, for he recollected that
he had shut it lest any one should come upon him suddenly.
But there was no key in the lock on the inside.
He might have dropped it, or slipped it into his wallet,
and he began to look for it, going round and round the
room and kicking the papers and account-books hither
and thither. It was not to be seen, and the windows
were heavily grated; but he did not doubt his strength
to break the door down. That was a mere trifle after
all.</p>

<p>He shook it violently, struck it, kicked it, and shook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
it again, but to his stupefaction it would not budge an
inch. The servants had pushed a heavy marble table
against it, and had piled up half a ton of furniture; he
might as well have tried to break through the wall.
Then it occurred to him that Omobono might have taken
the key. He would open the box, though it was a pity
to disturb a dead man in such an excellent coffin.</p>

<p>But the box could not be opened any more than the
door, for the springs had snapped, and he did not understand
the complicated locks. He tried again and again,
but failed each time. Perhaps the secretary was not
dead after all. Tocktamish would speak to him, and
ask him how to open the safe.</p>

<p>'Little man,' he said, 'I will let you out if you will tell
me how to use the keys.' But the little man did not
answer. If he was alive and heard, he had no desire to be
let out while his tormentor was in the house. At the
thought that he could perhaps hear, but would not
speak, Tocktamish went into a paroxysm of fury.</p>

<p>He seized the high stool that stood beside the desk
and swung it with terrific force, bringing it down on the
strong box, so that it flew into splinters with an appalling
din. He raged, he foamed at the mouth, he bawled and
yelled, and he smashed one piece of furniture after
another on the heavy iron without producing the smallest
impression on it, and without getting the least answer
from Omobono, who was still half-unconscious, happily
for his nerves, and was dreaming that he had taken refuge
in a baker's oven during a terrible thunderstorm.</p>

<p>The stool was reduced to kindling wood, two large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
chairs had followed it, and Tocktamish was in the act of
heaving up the desk itself, sending inkstand, pens, and
papers flying to the four corners of the room, and determined
to crack the strong box with one tremendous
blow, when a musical voice spoke gently through the
window nearest to him. Zoë and her maids were there,
and the whole household of men-servants and slaves were
behind them. The three girls were standing on the broad
stone seat that ran round the outside of the house in the
Italian way, and they could easily look through the bars.
In her haste Zoë had not veiled herself, and when the Tartar
caught sight of her beautiful face at the window, the
effect on his susceptible sentiments was instantaneous.
The vision was a hundred times more lovely than the
handsome Giustina who had escaped him. He had
never seen any one like Zoë as she stood outside in the
quiet afternoon sunshine. For a moment or two he was
almost sober; the desk fell from his hands upon the iron
chest, and was not even broken, and Tocktamish's
hands hung down by his sides while he stared in stupid
wonder.</p>

<p>Zoë was glad that there were iron bars between him
and her, for she had never seen a human being more
like a raging wild beast. She had looked anxiously for
Omobono, but as there was no trace of him nor of any
blood, she at once decided that he had been able to get
out by some secret way, after Lucilla had barred the
door.</p>

<p>'Where is Messer Carlo?' were the words which arrested
Tocktamish in the act of smashing the desk.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p>He stood gazing at Zoë stupidly, and as he did not
answer she repeated her question, watching him quietly
so that he should understand that he was completely
in her power. When he heard her voice again he made a
sort of instinctive attempt to smooth himself, as the peacock
spreads his tail before the female; he pulled out his
immense moustaches, drew his shaggy beard through his
two hands, settled his fur papakh on his head, and
smiled complacently as he approached the window,
prepared, in his own estimation, to win the heart of any
woman in Constantinople. The exercise of breaking up
the furniture had probably done him good, for he walked
quite steadily, with his eyes wide open and his big head a
little on one side.</p>

<p>'Messer Carlo is quite safe and very well,' he answered
when he was near the grating. 'He has sent me to get
him a little money, which he greatly needs.'</p>

<p>'You have a singular way of executing his commission,'
observed Zoë, looking at the splinters of the
smashed furniture.</p>

<p>Tocktamish felt that the havoc round him must be
explained.</p>

<p>'I have been killing the rats,' he said. 'It is extraordinary
how many rats and mice get into counting-houses!'</p>

<p>'Where is Messer Carlo?' Zoë asked a third time.</p>

<p>'Sweet woolly ewe-lamb of heaven,' said Tocktamish,
leaning on the window-sill and bringing his face close to
the bars, 'if you will only give me one little kiss, I will
tell you where Carlo is!'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>Zoë stepped to one side along the stone seat on which
she stood, for she saw that he was going to slip one of his
hands through the grating to catch her; and even with
the bars between them he looked as if he could twist
one of her arms off if she resisted him. Indeed, she was
hardly out of his reach in time. He laughed rather
vacantly as he grasped the air. The grating projected
several inches beyond the window, like the end of a
cage, as the gratings generally do in old Italian houses;
and though Zoë was on one side, Tocktamish could still
look at her.</p>

<p>'If you will come inside, I will tell you what you wish
to know, my little dove,' he said with an engaging leer,
for he did not really believe that any woman could resist
him.</p>

<p>'Thank you,' Zoë answered. 'I will not come in,
but I will warn you. If you will not tell me where
Messer Carlo is, I shall have you shot with the master's
crossbow, like a mad dog.'</p>

<p>'Shall I get the bow?' asked the voice of Carlo's man,
the Venetian gondolier, who was an excellent shot,
and had won a prize at the Lido.</p>

<p>But Tocktamish laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>'Your crossbow cannot shoot through the shutters,'
he said, for they were very heavy ones, at least three
inches thick. 'Besides,' he added, 'I can sit on the floor
under the window, and you will not even see me.'</p>

<p>'If we cannot shoot you, we can starve you,' retorted
Zoë.</p>

<p>'Little ewe-lamb,' said the Tartar, 'the heart of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
Tocktamish is fluttering for you like a moth in a lamp.
For one kiss you shall have anything you ask!'</p>

<p>'Do you understand that I mean to starve you?'
Zoë asked sternly.</p>

<p>'Oh no, my beautiful pink-and-white rabbit! You
will not be so hard-hearted! And besides, if you will
not let me out and give me a kiss, my men will come
presently and burn Carlo's house down, and I shall
carry you away! Ha ha! You had not thought of it!
But Tocktamish is not caught in the trap like a cub.
He is an old wolf, and knows the forest. My men know
I am here, and if I do not go back to them within this
hour they will come to get me. That was agreed, and
I can wait as long as that. Then sixty of them will
come, and before night we shall take Carlo to the Emperor
and give him up, and tell all we know; and to-morrow
morning he will be on a stake in the middle of the
Hippodrome, and it will be the third day before he is quite
dead! Ha ha! I remember how we watched that old
scoundrel Michael Rhangabé! I and my men were on
duty at that execution!'</p>

<p>Zoë's cheeks turned ghastly white, and her eyes
gleamed dangerously. If there had been a weapon
in her hand at that moment she could have aimed well
through the grating, and Tocktamish's days would have
ended abruptly. But on the other side of the bars the
drunken Tartar was laughing at his own skill in frightening
her, for he thought she turned pale from fear.</p>

<p>'Can no one silence this brute?' she cried in a tone that
trembled with anger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>

<p>'It is easily done,' said a voice she knew.</p>

<p>She turned and looked down from the little elevation
of the stone seat, and she saw the impassive face of
Gorlias Pietrogliant looking up to her.</p>

<p>'Come into the house, Kokóna,' he said, holding up a
hand to help her down. 'We will send him a pitcher of
Messer Carlo's oldest wine to help him pass an hour
before his men come to burn the house down!'</p>

<p>Zoë understood the wisdom of the advice; Tocktamish
would drink himself into a stupor in a short time.</p>

<p>'The astrologer is right,' she said to the servants.
'Come in with me, all of you.' She led the way, but
Gorlias lingered a moment, stepped upon the stone seat,
and spoke to the prisoner in a low voice.</p>

<p>'They will be here in half an hour,' he said. 'Meanwhile
I will send you wine to drink. Are you hungry?'</p>

<p>'Hungry?' Tocktamish laughed at the recollection
of the peacock. 'I never dined better! But send me
some wine, and when we divide, I will have that white-faced
girl for my share. The men may have the money
here. Tell them so.'</p>

<p>He slapped the well-filled leathern sack at his girdle
as he spoke.</p>

<p>'As you please,' Gorlias answered indifferently.</p>

<p>He stepped to the ground again and reached the door
in time to enter with the last of the train that followed
Zoë. In the dining-hall things had been left as they
were when Tocktamish and Omobono went out. The
table was in confusion, and flooded with wine that had
run down to the floor, and two or three chairs were upset.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
Gorlias filled a silver pitcher with Chian; but when he
turned towards the window Zoë was the only one who
saw him empty into the wine the contents of a small
vial which he seemed to have had ready in the palm of
his hand. He called Carlo's man.</p>

<p>'Take it to him,' he said. 'You can easily pass it
through the bars.'</p>

<p>'It is not much wine,' observed the man doubtfully.
'He will drink that at a draught.'</p>

<p>'If he asks for more, fill the pitcher again,' answered
Gorlias. 'If he falls asleep, let me know.'</p>

<p>The man went off.</p>

<p>'Clear away all that,' said Zoë to the men-servants
who stood looking on. 'The master must not find this
confusion when he comes home.'</p>

<p>Her tone and her manner imposed obedience, and
besides, they knew that Tocktamish was safe for a while.
They began to clear the table at once, and Zoë left the
room followed by Gorlias and her two maids, who had
been silent witnesses of what had passed.</p>

<p>Upstairs, they left her alone with the astrologer,
and disappeared to discuss in whispers the wonderful
things that were happening in the house.</p>

<p>'Where is he?' asked Zoë, as soon as the maids were
gone.</p>

<p>'He is in a dry cistern near the north wall of the
city.'</p>

<p>'Hiding?'</p>

<p>'No&mdash;a prisoner. In escaping last night he ran
among the soldiers who were to have helped us, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
they held him for a ransom. The Tartar came to extort
the money. You know all.'</p>

<p>'At least, he is safe for the present,' Zoë said, but very
doubtfully, for she did not half believe what she said.</p>

<p>'No,' Gorlias answered; 'he is not safe for long, and
we must get him out. They demand a ransom, but
they know well enough that even if they get it they will
not dare to let him go free, since he could hang them all
by a word.'</p>

<p>'What will they do?'</p>

<p>'If they can get the money they will let him starve
to death in the cistern. If they do not, they will give
him up to Andronicus for the reward. The Emperor
has proclaimed that he will give ten pounds of gold to any
one who will bring him Carlo Zeno, dead or alive. That
is not enough.'</p>

<p>'The Emperor knows it was he?' asked Zoë with
increasing anxiety.</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'How?'</p>

<p>'I do not know. Some one has betrayed us.'</p>

<p>'Us all?'</p>

<p>'I fear so.'</p>

<p>'But you yourself? Do you dare go about?'</p>

<p>'I have many disguises, and they who know the fisherman
do not know the astrologer.'</p>

<p>'But if you should be taken?'</p>

<p>'A man cannot change his destiny. But look here.
I have something from Johannes already. He has
changed his mind; he regrets not having let us take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
him out last night, and he sends me this by the captain's
wife.'</p>

<p>Gorlias produced a parchment document.</p>

<p>'What is it?'</p>

<p>'The gift of Tenedos to Venice.'</p>

<p>'Ah! If Messer Carlo were only free!'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;if!' Gorlias shook his head thoughtfully.
'It will not be easy to send an answer to this,' he went on.
'The woman brought it to me at the risk of her life,
and said it would be impossible for her to come again.
The guard is doubled, and a very different watch will
be kept in future. I do not believe that we can bring
Johannes out, as we might have done in spite of those
fellows last night. Yet I am sure that if Messer Carlo
were at liberty he would try. He would at least send
word, in answer to this. But the days are over when
we used to send letters up and down by a thread&mdash;the
tower is watched from the river now.'</p>

<p>'Can you not get in by a disguise?'</p>

<p>'No. There is not the least chance of gaining admittance
at present.'</p>

<p>'I could,' said Zoë confidently. 'I am sure I could!
If I went in carrying a basket of linen on my head and
dressed like a slave-girl in blue cotton with yellow leathern
shoes, I am sure they would let me go to the captain's
wife.'</p>

<p>'What if your basket were searched and the letter
found?'</p>

<p>'I would put it into my shoe. They would not look
for it there.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<p>'You would run a fearful risk.'</p>

<p>'For him, if it were of any use,' Zoë answered. 'But
it will not help him at all, and if anything happened to me
he would be sorry. Besides, why should we send a
message that pretends to come from Messer Carlo when
he himself is a prisoner?'</p>

<p>'This is the case,' Gorlias answered. 'The soldiers
will never let him out till they feel safe themselves;
and the only way to make them sure that there is no
danger is really and truly to bring Johannes out and set
him on the throne again. So long as Andronicus reigns
and may take vengeance on them, they will keep Messer
Carlo a prisoner to give up at any moment, or to starve
him to death for their own safety&mdash;unless they murder
him outright. But I do not believe that any ten of them
would dare to set upon him, for they know him
well.'</p>

<p>Zoë smiled, for she was proud to love a man whom ten
men would not dare to kill.</p>

<p>'Then the only way to save him is to free Johannes?'
she said. 'Yes,' she went on, not waiting for an answer,
'I think you are right. Even if we got them their ten
thousand ducats they would not let him out as long as
Andronicus is at Blachernæ.'</p>

<p>'That is the truth of it,' Gorlias answered. 'Neither
more nor less. Messer Carlo's life depends upon it.'</p>

<p>'Then it must be done, come what may. Thank
God, I have a life to risk for him!'</p>

<p>'You have two,' said Gorlias quietly. 'You have
mine also.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<p>'You are very loyal to Johannes, even to risking
death. Is that what you mean?'</p>

<p>'More than that.'</p>

<p>'For Messer Carlo, then?' Zoë asked. 'You owe him
some great debt of gratitude?'</p>

<p>'I never saw him until quite lately,' Gorlias answered.
'You need not know why I am ready to die in this
attempt, Kokóna Arethusa.'</p>

<p>Some one knocked at the outer door; Zoë clapped her
hands for her maids, and one of them went to the
entrance. The voice of Zeno's man spoke from outside.</p>

<p>'The Tartar is fast asleep already,' he said, 'and I can
hear the secretary moaning as if he were in great pain;
but I cannot see him through the window. He must be
somewhere in the room, for it is his voice.'</p>

<p>Zoë made a movement to go towards the door, but
Gorlias raised his hand.</p>

<p>'I will see to it,' he said, 'I will have the fellow taken
back to his quarters.'</p>

<p>Zoë bit her lip for she knew that it would be cruel and
cowardly to hurt even such a ruffian as Tocktamish,
while he was helpless under the drug Gorlias had given
him. But the words he had spoken rankled deep, and
it was not likely that she should forget them.</p>

<p>'Do as you will,' she said.</p>

<p>Half an hour later poor little Omobono was in his
bed, and Zeno's man was giving him a warm infusion
of marsh-mallows and camomile for his shaken nerves.
The money-bags and the papers had been restored to the
strong box in the counting-house, and Tocktamish the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Tartar, sunk in a beatific slumber, was being carried to his
quarters in a hired palanquin by four stalwart bearers.</p>

<p>That was the end of the memorable feast in Carlo
Zeno's house.</p>

<p>But Zoë sat by the open window, and her heart beat
sometimes very fast and sometimes very slow; for she
understood that the plight of the man she loved was
desperate indeed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p>The position of Zeno was quite clear to Zoë now, and a
great wave of happiness lifted her and bore her on with
it as she realised that she might save his life just when
his chances looked most hopeless, and that whether
she succeeded or failed her own must certainly be staked
for his. Heroism is nearer the surface in women than in
most men, and often goes quite as deep.</p>

<p>Zoë had understood very suddenly how matters stood,
and that Tocktamish and his men meant to let Zeno
perish, simply because he might ruin them all if he
regained his liberty; or, if it were found out that he was
taken, they intended to hand him over to Andronicus.
It was not at all likely that they would set him free even
if they got the great ransom they demanded.</p>

<p>But if by any means Johannes could be brought
suddenly from his prison, all Constantinople would rise
in revolution to set him on the throne, and it would be as
dangerous to keep his friend Zeno in confinement as it
now seemed rash to his captors to let him out. The first
thing to be done was to reach Johannes himself and warn
him, and this could only be accomplished by a woman.
Gorlias knew the soldiers, and had as much influence with
them as any one, perhaps, and whatever could be done
from without he would do; yet it was quite certain that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
the men could not be got together again unless Johannes
were actually free.</p>

<p>The difficulty lay there. To reach him was one
thing, and was within the bounds of possibility; to bring
him out would be quite another. But Zoë had confidence
in the devotion of the captain's wife, of whom
Gorlias had told her, and believed that in such a case
two women could do more than ten men.</p>

<p>Yet she saw that it might be fatal to let the imprisoned
Emperor know that Zeno was himself a prisoner.
To prevent this she conceived the plan of writing a letter
in the Venetian's name, accepting on behalf of the Republic
the gift of Tenedos, and promising instant help
and liberty. Zeno had given his word that he would
renew the attempt for the sake of Tenedos, though for
nothing else; this condition being accepted, she knew
that nothing could hinder him from keeping his word if he
were free. She would therefore only be writing for him
what he himself would write if he could; and besides, if
she needed a more valid excuse, it would be done to save
his life.</p>

<p>Her learning stood her in good stead now as she carefully
penned the answer on stout Paduan paper. She
made Zeno thank the Emperor on behalf of the Serene
Republic for his generous gift, and say that he was ready,
that not a moment should be lost, and that in an hour
the sovereign should be restored to his people, or Carlo
Zeno would die in the attempt.</p>

<p>This last phrase, as it ran from her pen, seemed to her
a little too theatrical to be Zeno's own, but she determined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
to let it stand for the sake of the impression it
should make on Johannes. Zeno would no more have
mentioned such a trifle as the risk of life and limb in
anything he meant to do than seamen would stop to
talk of danger when ordered to shorten sail in a dangerous
gale. Such things are a part of the game. No sailor
will spin a yarn about a storm unless he has seen the
Flying Dutchman or the Sea Serpent or the Man in the
Top; he is in danger half his life. But the average
modern soldier, who may be under fire three or four
times in his career, repeats the story of his battles to any
one who will listen. Zoë did not know whether Johannes
had ever seen Zeno's handwriting or not, but that mattered
little in those days, when many fine gentlemen
could not write their own letters. She folded the sheet
neatly in a small square, and placed it in her shoe by
way of experiment, to see whether it would stay there
while she walked.</p>

<p>She did all this while Gorlias was gone, and before he
came back the afternoon was half over, though the
spring days were growing long. He told her that the
Tartar was safe in his quarters, where he would probably
sleep till midnight at the very least, to the infinite rage
and disgust of his men. They had expected him to
return laden with gold or with the secure promise of it,
and he had come back not only empty-handed, but hopelessly
drunk; and as they knew him well, but did not
know that he had swallowed a dose of opium that would
have sent a tiger to sleep, they meditated in gloomy
thirst on the quantity of strong wine he must have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
absorbed during an absence which had only lasted two
hours. What he had told Zoë of their coming to fetch
him if he stayed too long had been a pure invention to
frighten her; they did not even know where he had been,
for he had merely announced his intention of going out
to collect Zeno's ransom from the Venetian merchants,
and his reputation for strength and ferocity was such that
they had not dreamed of his needing help.</p>

<p>Thus much Gorlias had found out, and he had also
ascertained that the men were in a thoroughly bad temper
in consequence of the turn affairs had taken, and much
more inclined to murder Zeno than to let him out. As
for his whereabouts, Gorlias only knew that he was in
one of the many dry cisterns, which existed under old
Constantinople, and which had never been in use since
the crusaders had cut the aqueducts and sacked the
city more than a hundred and seventy years earlier.
The men who had shut up Zeno knew where he was,
but it was very likely that they had not told their comrades.
In those last days of the Empire the foreign
mercenaries were little better than bands of robbers,
half-trained at that, who preyed on the peasant part of
the population, obeying their officers only when it was
worth the trouble, and not even practising thieves'
honour in the division of plunder. Not a day passed
then without brawl and bloodshed amongst the soldiery;
hardly a night went by without some act of violence
and depredation for which they were responsible. They
had stolen under Johannes, they robbed under Andronicus;
under Johannes restored, they would steal again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
And they drank perpetually. If Sultan Amurad had been
the man that Mohammed the Conqueror turned out to
be, the Turks would have been in possession of Constantinople
fully eighty years before they actually stormed it,
and with a tenth of the loss.</p>

<p>If Zeno had relied on the eight hundred soldiers who
had agreed to make a revolution for Johannes, he had
done so because he knew they could be trusted to rise
if there was a chance of plundering the palace and of
cutting the throats of a few hundred of their divers
countrymen who had been preferred before them as a
body-guard, and were therefore their sworn enemies.
But the instant those delightful prospects disappeared
they cared no more who was Emperor than a cur cares
who throws him a bone; the existing condition of things
was good enough for them, and they would risk nothing
to change it, unless change meant wine, women, and loot.
Many of them were in reality Mohammedans like Tocktamish,
and looked upon all Christians, including their
employers, as their lawful prey&mdash;as dogs, moreover,
and no great fighters at that, but mostly cowardly curs.
It was agreeable to live amongst them because one could
beat them and drink wine without the disapproval
of the greybeards; but as for respecting them, a Tartar
like Tocktamish would as soon have thought of fearing
them.</p>

<p>Zoë knew all this, and so did Gorlias, and they agreed
that unless Johannes could be brought visibly before the
soldiers there was little chance of success, and none of
saving Zeno. The difficulty lay in the fact that Johannes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
was kept in a place even more inaccessible than Zeno's
cistern. The whole matter was a vicious circle. He
could not be set free unless the troops rose for him;
but the troops would not rise unless they saw him in
their midst; and if there were no rising Zeno would be
starved to death in the well. Gorlias Pietrogliant was a
man of resources, but the problem completely baffled him.</p>

<p>He stood silent and in thought at Zoë's window;
she sat quite motionless on the great divan, watching
him and thinking too. Her knees were drawn up almost
to her chin, and her folded hands clasped them while
she looked straight at the astrologer's back with unwinking
eyes. Neither he nor she knew how long they
kept silence; it might have been five minutes, or it
might have been half an hour. Time plays queer tricks
when people are in great danger or in great distress.</p>

<p>Then Zoë's expression began to change very slowly,
as an idea dawned upon her. It was as if she saw something
between her and Gorlias, something that took
shape by degrees, something new and unexpected that
presently grew to be a whole picture, and from a picture
became a real scene, full of living people, moving and
talking; the tender mouth opened a little as if she were
going to speak, and the delicate nostril quivered, the
colour spread like dawn in her pale cheeks, and a deep
warm light came into her eyes.</p>

<p>When the scene was over and the vision disappeared,
she nodded slowly, as if satisfied that in her waking dream
she had dreamed true.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_347" id="i_347"></a>
<img src="images/i_347.jpg" width="469" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Then, all at once, he felt that she had received one of those inspirations of the
practical sense which visit women who are driven to extremities.</p>
</div>

<p>'I have thought of a way,' she said at last.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span></p>

<p>Gorlias turned, crossed the room, and stood beside
her to listen; but he did not think she had any practicable
scheme to propose, and at first, while she was speaking,
he was much more inclined to follow his own line of
thought than hers. Then, all at once, he felt that she
had received one of those inspirations of the practical
sense which visit women who are driven to extremities,
and which have been the wonder of men since Jacob's
mother showed him how to steal his father's blessing.
It is quite certain that it was a woman who showed
Columbus the trick with the egg, when he himself was
trying to balance one on its point. Only a woman could
have thought of anything so simple.</p>

<p>And now, after Gorlias had vainly racked his ingenious
brain for an idea, it was the girl that suggested the only
possible one. He grasped it easily.</p>

<p>'It is a daring plan, and it could not succeed in broad
daylight,' he said, when she had finished, 'but it may at
dusk.'</p>

<p>'It must,' Zoë said emphatically. 'If it fails, we shall
not see each other again.'</p>

<p>'Not unless it occurs to Andronicus to crucify us
together,' Gorlias answered, rather gravely. 'Very
much depends on our timing ourselves as exactly as
possible.'</p>

<p>'Yes. Let it be a little more than half an hour after
sunset, just when the dusk is closing in. Have you
everything you need?'</p>

<p>'I can get what is lacking. We have three good hours
still before us.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span></p>

<p>'Go, then, and do not be late. You know what will
happen to me if you do not come just at the right time.'</p>

<p>'You are risking more than I,' Gorlias said.</p>

<p>'I have more to lose, and more to win,' Zoë answered.</p>

<p>She was thinking of Zeno,&mdash;of life with him, of
life without him, and of the life she would give for his.
But Gorlias wondered at her courage, for it was held
nothing in those days to tear a living man or woman to
shreds, piecemeal, on the mere suspicion of treason, and
that would surely be her fate if he could not carry out
precisely and successfully the plan she had thought of.
A delay of half an hour might mean death to her, though
it would not of necessity affect the result so far as Johannes
and Zeno were concerned.</p>

<p>Gorlias left her to make his own preparations. When
he was gone Zoë sent Yulia for Zeno's own man, Vito,
the Venetian boatman. He came and stood on the
threshold while she spoke to him, out of the maids'
hearing, and in Italian, lest they should creep near and
listen.</p>

<p>'Vito,' said Zoë, 'how is the secretary?'</p>

<p>'Excellency,' the Venetian answered, 'fear is an ugly
sickness, which makes healthy men tremble worse than
the fever does.'</p>

<p>He either forgot that he was supposed to be speaking
to a slave who had no more claim to be called 'Excellency'
than he had himself, and less, if anything;
or else he had made up his mind that this beautiful
Arethusa whom he had to-day seen for the first time,
was not a slave at all, but a great lady in disguise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span></p>

<p>'You are never frightened, are you, Vito?' she asked
with a smile.</p>

<p>'I?' Vito grinned. 'Am I of iron, or of stone?
Or am I perhaps a lion? When there is fear I am afraid.'</p>

<p>'But the master is never frightened,' suggested Zoë.
'Is he of stone, then?'</p>

<p>'Oh, he!' Vito laughed now, and shrugged his
shoulders. 'Would you compare me with the master?
Then compare copper with gold. The master is the
master, and that is enough, but I am only a sailor man
in his service. If there is fighting, I fight while I see
that I am the stronger, but when I see that I may die
I run away. We are all thus.'</p>

<p>'But surely you would not run away and leave Messer
Carlo to be killed, would you?'</p>

<p>'No,' Vito answered quite simply. 'That would be
another affair. It would be shame to go home alive if
the master were killed. When one must die, one must,
as God wills. It may be for the master, it may be for
Venice. But for myself, I ask you? Why should I die
for nothing? I run away. It is more sensible.'</p>

<p>'You need not risk being killed if you do what I am
going to ask,' Zoë said, for after talking with the man she
liked his honest face, and thought none the less of him
for his frankness. 'It is a very simple matter.'</p>

<p>'What is it, Excellency?'</p>

<p>'You need not call me that, Vito,' answered Zoë. 'I
want you to row me at sunset to the landing which is
nearest to the palace gate. It must be the dirty little
one on this side of the Amena tower, is it not?'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span></p>

<p>'That is it. But without the master's orders&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Vito looked at her doubtfully, for he had been reminded
that she considered herself a slave, and it occurred to him
that she meant to escape in Zeno's absence.</p>

<p>'Messer Carlo would wish me to go, if he were here,'
said Zoë quietly, and not at all as if she were insisting,
for she saw what was the matter.</p>

<p>'I have no doubt it is as you say,' Vito answered. 'But
I have no orders.'</p>

<p>'There is a message from the master to some one in the
palace,' Zoë explained. 'No one but I can deliver it.'</p>

<p>'That is easily said,' observed Vito bluntly. 'There
are no orders.'</p>

<p>Zoë felt the blood rising to her forehead at the man's
rudeness and distrust of her, but she controlled herself,
for much depended on obtaining what she wished.</p>

<p>'It is not a message,' she said; 'it is a letter.'</p>

<p>'Where is it?' asked Vito incredulously.</p>

<p>'I will show it to you,' Zoë answered, but she first
turned to the maids, who waited at the end of the room.
'Go and prepare me the bath,' she said.</p>

<p>The two disappeared, though they did not believe that
their mistress really wished to bathe again so soon.
When they were gone, she stooped and took the letter
from her shoe, unfolded it, and spread it out for Vito to
see. The effect it made upon him was instantaneous; he
looked at it carefully, and took a corner of it between his
thumb and finger.</p>

<p>'This is the paper on which the master writes,' he said,
as if convinced.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>It did not occur to him that the slave Arethusa could
write at all, nor any one else in the house except Omobono;
and as for the latter, if he had written anything
he must have done so under Zeno's orders. Writing of
any sort commanded his profound and almost superstitious
respect.</p>

<p>'This is certainly a letter from the master,' he said,
satisfied at last, after what he considered a thoroughly
conscientious inspection.</p>

<p>'And he wishes me to deliver it,' Zoë said. 'If I am
to do that, you must be good enough to take me to the
landing in the boat. There is no other way.'</p>

<p>'I could take the letter myself,' Vito suggested.</p>

<p>'No. Only a woman will be allowed to pass, where
this must go.'</p>

<p>Vito began to understand, and nodded his head wisely.</p>

<p>'It is for Handsome John,' he said, with conviction,
and fixing his eyes on Zoë's. 'It is for the other Emperor,
whom the master wishes to set free.'</p>

<p>'Yes&mdash;since you have guessed it,' Zoë answered.
'Will you take me now?'</p>

<p>'You will take one of your slaves with you, as you do
when you go out in the boat with the secretary, I suppose?'</p>

<p>Vito still felt a little hesitation.</p>

<p>'No. I must go alone with you. And I myself shall
be dressed like a slave, and I shall have a basket of things
to carry on my head to the wife of the gaoler.'</p>

<p>'I see,' said Vito, who really loved adventure for its
own sake, and was much less inclined to run away from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
danger than he represented. 'Did you say you wished
to go at sunset?'</p>

<p>'Yes.'</p>

<p>'I shall be ready. But it will be better to take an old
boat, and I will put on ragged clothes, to look like a
hired boatman.'</p>

<p>'Yes; that will be better.'</p>

<p>Vito went away, delighted with the prospect before
him. He was too young and too true a Venetian not to
look forward with pleasure to rowing the beautiful
Arethusa up the Golden Horn, though he was only a
servant and she was the master's most treasured possession.
He felt, too, some manly pride in the thought
of possibly protecting her, for he meant to follow her
ashore and look on from a distance, to see whether she
got safely into the tower, and he would wait until she
came out. The master would expect that much of him,
at least.</p>

<p>As yet, neither Vito nor any member of the household,
except Zoë, knew that Zeno was a prisoner, held for
ransom. It had pleased him to go out of his house during
the previous night, and some important business
detained him; that was all. When he was at leisure he
would come home. The men-servants who had waited
on the guests and had heard Tocktamish's words, to the
effect that Zeno had sent him for money, looked upon
the statement as a clumsy trick which the half-drunken
robber was trying to play in Zeno's absence, and as
nothing more. But they had been far too badly frightened
to stay and listen, as has been seen. To Vito, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
was, nevertheless, by far the best of them, it had been
a matter of utter indifference whether the Tartar cut the
throats of the four guests or not, compared with the urgent
necessity of keeping out of his reach. If the master
had been present another side of their character would
have come into play, but as he was absent they had
thought of their own safety first.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p>The sun had set, and the wide court of Blachernæ
was filled with purple light to the wall tops, like a
wine-vat full to the brim; and everything that was
in the glow took colour from it, as silver does in
claret, the polished trappings of the guards' uniforms,
the creamy marble steps of the palace, the white Tunisian
charger of the officer who rode in just then, and the
swallows that circled round and round the courtyard.
The world moved in that short deep dream that comes
just when the sun has slipped away to rest, when the
light is everywhere at once, so that things cast no shadows
on the ground, because they glow from within, as in
fairyland, or perhaps in heaven.</p>

<p>The officer rode in on his charger, and after him entered
a girl slave, dressed in coarse blue cotton, and carrying
on her head a small round basket, which was covered
with a clean white cloth. The four corners of the napkin
hung down, and one of them would have flapped across
her face if she had not held it between her teeth to keep
it down. It partly hid her features, and her head was
tied up in a blue cotton kerchief passed twice round and
knotted upon her forehead. She limped a little as she
walked. What could be seen of her face was pale and
quiet, and had a rather fixed look.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span></p>

<p>She was walking boldly through the gate, without slackening
her pace, when one of the two sentinels stopped
her, and asked where she was going. She stood still,
and one hand steadied the basket on her head, while the
other pointed to the Amena tower.</p>

<p>'My mistress sends some fine wheat bread and cream
cheese to the wife of the captain who keeps the tower,'
said Zoë, affecting the mincing accent very common
with female slaves and Greek ladies' maids.</p>

<p>The second sentinel, returning on his short beat, now
came up and stood on her other side. He was a big
Bulgarian, and he lifted one corner of the cloth and looked
down into the basket, merely for the sake of detaining
the girl. He saw the wheaten loaves and the cream
cheese neatly disposed on a second napkin, and the cheese
was nested in green leaves to keep it fresh. Both the
soldiers at once thought of tasting it with the points of
their daggers, but at that moment the officer of the watch
strolled out of the guard-house, a magnificent young
man in scarlet and gold. The two sentinels at once
turned their backs on the cheese and Zoë, and marched
away in opposite directions on their beats, leaving her
standing in the middle. The officer was far too high and
mighty a person to look at a slave-girl or her basket,
and Zoë therefore went on without turning her head,
taking it for granted that she was now free to enter. In
her baggy blue cotton clothes, and with her face almost
covered by the napkin, there was nothing about her to
attract attention, unless it were her slightly limping gait;
and she instinctively made an effort to walk evenly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
for she could not help feeling ashamed of being suddenly
lame, as perfectly sound and healthy people do. But
she realised that the folded letter was in the wrong shoe
and increased her lameness, whereas if she had carried
it in the other it might have made walking easier.</p>

<p>She went from under the great gate into the liquid
purple light in the court, and it was pleasant to be in it.
But then again it made her think of yesterday, when she
had sat in her window at sunset, not dreaming of all that
was to happen to her in one night and one day. It
made her think of the man she loved so dearly, imprisoned
somewhere under the great city, starving and thirsting
no doubt, and face to face with thoughts of death; and
it was to save him that she was crossing the courtyard
of Blachernæ disguised as a household slave. It
was because there was no other way; and if Gorlias
Pietrogliant failed her, or came too late, the end would
overtake her in a few hours, or perhaps quite suddenly,
which would be more merciful. She knew what she
was doing, and she did not deceive herself. They would
put out her eyes first; but that would be the least of
the cruel things they would do to her, if Gorlias failed.</p>

<p>She was only a weak girl, after all, and once or twice,
when she thought of the pain, a sharp little shiver ran
down her back to her very heels, and things swam before
her for an instant in the deep sea of colour; but that only
lasted for a moment, and when she reached the foot of the
tower and went in under the archway that led to the
door, she was thinking of Zeno again, and of nothing
else.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span></p>

<p>It was as Gorlias had told her. A very different watch
was set there since the attempt of the previous night,
and she found herself face to face with an obstacle she
had not anticipated. The iron door was shut and was
guarded by two huge Africans in black mail armour,
who stood on either side with drawn scimitars.</p>

<p>They looked over her head as she approached them,
and they seemed to take no notice of her existence.
She thought she had never seen such expressionless faces
as theirs; the features were as shiny and motionless as
bronze, and the purple haze of the sunset without filled
the deep arch and lent them an unnatural colour which
was positively terrifying.</p>

<p>'If you please, kind sirs,' Zoë began as she stood still,
'my mistress sends some fine wheat bread and fresh
cream cheese to the wife of the captain.'</p>

<p>She might as well have spoken to statues; neither of
the negroes paid the slightest attention. But she was
not to be put off so easily.</p>

<p>'If you please,' she repeated with pleading emphasis
and more loudly, 'my mistress&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She stopped speaking in the middle of the sentence,
suddenly scared by the immobility of the two black
men, and by their size, and by the purple glare that was
reflected from their great polished scimitars, of which
one noiseless sweep could sever her head from her body.
They were like the genii in one of those tales of the
Arabian Nights which Greek story-tellers were then just
learning from the Persians, and from the Tartar merchants
of Samarcand and Tashkent. Zoë had listened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
to them by the hour when she was a little girl, and now
she suddenly felt an irrational conviction that she had
dreamed herself into one of them, and that the imprisoned
Emperor was guarded by supernatural beings.</p>

<p>However, when she looked at the motionless features
and at the broad, polished blades, she did not feel that
painful shiver which had run down her when she had
thought of being tortured by the people of the palace,
and she soon took courage again and began to speak a
third time.</p>

<p>'If you please,' she said, but she got no further, for
she had gently plucked at the mailed sleeve of the man
on her right, to attract his attention, and he moved at
once, and bent down a little.</p>

<p>He touched his ear with his left forefinger and shook
his head slowly to show that he was deaf, and pointed to
his companion and back to his own ear and shook his
head again; and then, to Zoë's horror, he opened his
enormous mouth just before her eyes, and she saw that
it was empty. He had no tongue.</p>

<p>Johannes was guarded by deaf mutes, and Zoë knew
Constantinople and the ways of the palace well enough
to understand that they were placed there to make an
end of any one, man or woman, who should attempt to
pass.</p>

<p>She tried signs, now. She took her basket from her
head and set it down on the step between the sentinels,
and crouched on her heels to uncover it and show the
contents. The men saw and nodded, and then inclined
their heads to one side in that peculiar way which means
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
indifference all over the East. And indeed they did
not care whether the basket held cheese or sweetmeats,
and their faces grew stony again as they looked outwards,
over her head.</p>

<p>She covered up her little basket disconsolately and rose
to her feet. The glow was beginning to fade in the
courtyard, and she felt her heart sink as the shadows
deepened. It was absolutely necessary to the success
of the dangerous enterprise on which she and Gorlias
had embarked, that Johannes himself, or at least the
captain's wife should be warned of what was to take
place in less than half an hour. If this could not be
done, everything might go wrong at the last minute,
their cleverly concerted trick would fail and be exposed,
and she and Gorlias, and Zeno himself, would probably
pay for their audacity with their lives.</p>

<p>The closed door between the sentinels was covered
with iron and studded with big nails. It was perfectly
clear that it must be opened from within, if at all, and
that the men themselves would have to knock or make
some other signal by sound in order to obtain entrance
for any one who was really authorised to go in. It was
also clear that if the men on the other side of the door
were stone deaf like the two guards, they could not hear
any such knocking, and no entrance would be possible
at all except when those within opened for some reason
of their own or at fixed hours. Again, thought Zoë, it
followed that there was probably some one near who
could hear sounds from without, and there was always
a bare possibility, in such times, that this person might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
be a secret friend to the prisoner, though supposed to
be one of his gaolers.</p>

<p>All these thoughts flashed across her mind in a few
seconds, while she was covering her basket. She therefore
took rather more time over this than was necessary,
and as the mutes did not show signs of driving her away,
she at once began to sing, quite sure that they could not
hear her. It was a forlorn hope, indeed, but anything was
worth trying. Her voice sounded loud and clear under
the archway:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>Over the water to my love, for the hour is come!</p>
<p>The water, the blue water, the water salt and the water fresh!</p>
<p>Open, my very dear love, open thy door to me,</p>
<p>For I have come swiftly over the water&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>At this point, to Zoë's inexpressible amazement and
delight, the door really opened, and she almost choked
for sheer joy.</p>

<p>The captain's wife appeared in the dim evening light,
standing well within, and Zoë recognised her at once
from the description Gorlias had given of her. The
sentinels, being perfectly deaf, did not at first know
that the door had been opened, as they stood looking
straight before them. The stout woman spoke in a low
voice.</p>

<p>'By four toes and by five toes,' she said, by way of
answer to the words Zoë had sung.</p>

<p>The girl lost no time, for there was none to lose, and
though there was little light she saw that there were
four or five more armed Ethiopians in the small chamber,
so that it would be impossible to deliver her letter.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>'Tell him from Carlo Zeno to be ready at once,' she
said quickly, 'and not to show surprise at anything that
happens.'</p>

<p>The deaf mutes outside now perceived that she was
speaking with some one, and that the entrance behind
them was open. She had just handed her basket to the
captain's wife when the two turned together to see who
had opened, but almost at the same instant the heavy
iron door swung quickly on its hinges again and shut with
a clang that echoed out to the courtyard. Zoë sprang
back hastily lest the door itself should strike her as it
closed, and the quick movement hurt her a little, for
she made a false step on the foot with which she limped,
turning it slightly as her weight came upon it.</p>

<p>That one step nearly cost her life, for though the sentinels
were deaf and dumb they were not blind. She
thought they were going to let her go away unhindered,
and she was already almost out of the archway when she
felt herself seized by the arms from behind.</p>

<p>When she had stumbled, her low shoe had turned a
little, and the folded letter, now useless, had fallen out.
As it was white, the guards had seen it instantly on the
dark pavement, and one of them had picked it up while
the other had caught her.</p>

<p>Zoë instinctively struggled with all her might for a
few seconds, but the dumb man twisted one of her arms
behind her till it was agony to move, and she was powerless.
Her captor now handed her over to his companion,
who had sheathed his scimitar and had placed the letter
inside his steel cap. She could not look round, but she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
felt that the grip on her twisted wrist changed, and she
was pushed out into the courtyard and made to walk
in the direction of the palace. She could not help limping
much more than before, and in the grasp of the big
Ethiopian she felt what a small weak thing she would
be in the tormentors' hands if Gorlias did not come in
time.</p>

<p>The purple light had almost faded below, and the
grey dusk was creeping up out of the ground, though
the high upper story of the marble palace was still
bathed in the evening glow, and still a few swallows
circled round the eaves. Zoë looked up to the vast
cornices and at the fleecy pink clouds that floated in the
sky, and as she was forced along, almost as fast as she
could walk, she wondered whether she should ever again
see the bright noonday sun. It would not take long to
kill her if Gorlias did not come in time.</p>

<p>There were many men coming and going now, and
there were guards in scarlet, drawn up at the entrance
to the palace as if they were waiting. Some slaves,
hastening away, paused a moment to watch Zoë go by,
smooth-faced creatures who lived among the Emperor's
women.</p>

<p>'There goes five hundred ducats' worth!' laughed one,
in a voice like a girl's.</p>

<p>'What has she done?' asked another, of the dumb
Ethiopian.</p>

<p>The speaker was a newcomer in the palace, and the
others jeered at him for not knowing that the man was
one of the mutes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span></p>

<p>And he pushed and dragged Zoë along without
noticing them. She looked straight before her now, at
the palace door, and as she went, she was in a kind of
dream, and she wondered what the room to which she
was being taken would be like, the place where she was
presently to be tortured if Gorlias did not come in time;
she wondered whether it would be light or dark, and what
the colour of the walls would be.</p>

<p>The African hurt her very much as he forced her
along, though she made no resistance; but she did not
think of the pain she felt, nor of the pain she would surely
be made to feel presently. It was as if she were detached
from her own personality, and could speculate about
what was going to happen to her, and about the men
who would ask her questions, and about the queer-looking
instruments of torture that would be brought,
and even the colour of the executioner's hair. She fancied
him a red-haired man with ugly, yellow eyes and bad
teeth that he showed. She did not know whether it
were fear or courage that so took her out of herself.</p>

<p>But all the time she was listening for a distant sound
that might come, or that might not; and her hearing
grew so sharp that she could have heard it a mile away,
and the distance between her and the palace door grew
shorter very quickly, and the ruthless mute urged her
along faster and faster, though she limped so badly.</p>

<p>Then her heart leapt and stood still a moment, and
the Ethiopian's grasp relaxed a little, and he slackened
his pace. Not that he heard what she heard, for he was
stone deaf; but the guards who stood about the door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
had begun to range themselves in even ranks on either
side, and a tall officer made signs to the African to stand
out of the way. The air rang with the music of distant
silver trumpets, there was a subdued hum of many
voices and the trampling of many horses' hoofs on the
hard earth outside the court.</p>

<p>'The Emperor comes!' cried the officer, again motioning
the mute and his prisoner away.</p>

<p>The man understood well enough, and dragged her
aside quickly and roughly out of the straight way, but
not out of sight; and the sounds grew louder, and the
trumpet-notes clearer, as the imperial cavalcade passed
in under the great gate. First there rode a score of
guards on their white horses; six running footmen came
next, in short hose and red tunics that fitted close to their
bodies and glared in the twilight; then two officers of
the household on their chargers; and young Andronicus
himself rode in on a bay Arab mare between two ministers
of state, followed by many more guards who pressed
close upon him to protect him from any treacherous
attack. He was dressed all in cloth of gold, and his tall
Greek cap was wrought with gold and jewels; but the
day had gone down, and neither the metal nor the
stones gave any light, while the scarlet uniforms of the
guards and footmen surged about him like waves of
blood in the gathering dusk.</p>

<p>The Ethiopian held Zoë pinioned by the arms and
looked over her head as the Emperor came near. Andronicus
had pale and suspicious eyes that searched
every crowd for danger, and saw peril everywhere. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
hung his head a little, his jaw was heavy, his lip was
loose, and his uneasy glance wandered continually
hither and thither. There was still plenty of light near
the palace, and Zoë saw every little thing; and the cloth
of gold he wore was lit up again by the reflexion from
the marble walls.</p>

<p>He saw the girl, too, but though her hands were behind
her, he did not see at once that the African held them,
for she stood quite still and met his gaze. Then he perceived
that the face was the most lovely he had ever
seen, and he made a motion in the saddle that was like
the rising of the snake when its prey is near, and his pale
eyes gleamed, and his loose lower lip shook and moved
against the upper one.</p>

<p>He drew rein and spoke in a low tone to the minister
on his right, a Greek with a fawning face, who instantly
made a sign to the girl to come nearer; and the Ethiopian
mute saw the gesture, and pushed her forward with
one hand, close to the Emperor's stirrup, and with the
other hand he took his steel cap very carefully from his
head, drawing it down close to his head and over his ear
so that the letter should not fall out; then, still grasping
Zoë's wrist, he held the helmet up like a cup, so that
Andronicus might see what was in it.</p>

<p>The action needed no explaining, for the young usurper
had himself ordered that his father should be guarded
by the dumb Ethiopians after the alarm of the previous
night. The Emperor looked down at the girl's beautiful
white face, but he took the letter from the soldier's
steel cap and spread it out, and read it quickly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
then passed it to the minister at his elbow, who read it
too.</p>

<p>He looked at Zoë again, but in his eyes her beauty
was all gone at once. She was one of those monsters
that were always conspiring against him, against his
throne and his life; she was one of those thousands
whom he saw nightly in his dreams of fear, stealing upon
him when he was alone and helpless, to blind him and
kill him, and to bear his crowned father to the throne
high on their shoulders. Zoë might have been as lovely
as Aphrodite herself, just wafted from the foam of the
sea by the breath of spring; to Andronicus she would
have been but one of the countless evil beings who for
ever plotted his destruction.</p>

<p>But this one was in his power. He sat on his horse
and looked down at her, and his loose lips smiled; yet
her face was still and proud, and in her poor blue cotton
slave's dress she faced him like a young goddess.</p>

<p>'Who sent you with this?' he asked in the deep
silence, and every man there listened for her answer.</p>

<p>'Since you have read it, you know,' she answered,
and there was no tremor in her voice.</p>

<p>'Take care! Where is this Venetian, this Zeno?'</p>

<p>'I do not know.'</p>

<p>'Take care, again! I ask, where is he?'</p>

<p>Zoë was silent for a moment, and though she did not
take her eyes from the young Emperor's face she listened
intently for a distant sound that did not come.</p>

<p>'I do not know where he is,' she said at last, 'but I
think you will see him before long, for he is coming here.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>

<p>'Here?' Andronicus was taken by surprise. 'Here?'
he repeated in wonder.</p>

<p>'Yes, here,' Zoë answered, 'and soon. He has business
here to-night.'</p>

<p>'The girl is mad,' said the Emperor, looking towards
the ministers.</p>

<p>'Quite mad, your august Majesty,' said one.</p>

<p>'Evidently out of her mind, Sire,' echoed the other.
'It will be well to put out her eyes and let her go.'</p>

<p>The one who had spoken first, the fawning Greek,
made a sign to an officer near him, and the latter gave
an order to one of the running footmen who stood
waiting. The latter instantly ran in through the great
open doorway of the palace. Where Andronicus was,
the torturer was never hard to find.</p>

<p>'And pray,' asked the Emperor, with an ugly smile,
'what possible business can a Venetian merchant have
here at this hour? Will you please to tell us?'</p>

<p>'A business that will be soon despatched, if God will,'
answered Zoë.</p>

<p>She could not look away from the man who had murdered
Michael Rhangabé, and though she knew what she was
risking if she did not gain time, the longing for just
vengeance was too strong for her, so that she could not
control her speech, and in her clear young voice Andronicus
heard an accent that struck terror to his heart.</p>

<p>'She is not mad!' he exclaimed in sudden anxiety.
'She knows something! Make her speak!'</p>

<p>While the words were on his lips the running footman
returned, and after him another man came quickly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
carrying a worn leathern bag. He was very tall and
thin, and he stooped, he had the face of a corpse and
there was no light in his eyes. Zoë did not see him, but
he came and stood behind her, close to the Ethiopian,
and he fumbled in his bag; and all around the uniforms
of the guard were as red as blood in the twilight.</p>

<p>'I am not afraid to speak, since I am caught,' Zoë
said, answering the Emperor's words, 'and what I say
is true. For what you owe me, you owe to many and
many more, and the name of that debt is blood!'</p>

<p>'She is raving!' cried Andronicus in an unsteady
voice.</p>

<p>'No, I am not mad,' Zoë answered, speaking loud
and clear. 'Your reckoning has been due these two
years, and a man is coming within the hour to claim it,
and you shall pay all, both to others and to me, whether
you will or not!'</p>

<p>'Who is this creature?' asked the Emperor, but his
cheeks were whiter now.</p>

<p>Not a sound broke the silence, and the man with the
leathern bag crept a little nearer to the defenceless girl,
and the Ethiopian's grip tightened on her wrists. From
somewhere beyond the walls of the courtyard the neighing
of a horse broke the stillness.</p>

<p>'Who is this girl that dares me within my own gates?'
Andronicus asked again, turning to his ministers and
officers.</p>

<p>The Greek with the fawning face bent in his saddle
towards the young Emperor as if he were prostrating
himself, and he spoke in a very low voice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>

<p>'Your Majesty would do well to have her tongue torn
out before she says more.'</p>

<p>'Who is she, I say?' cried the sovereign, suddenly
furious, as cowards can be.</p>

<p>No one spoke. The corpse-faced man crept nearer to
Zoë, his dull eyes fixed on her features. Beyond the
wall and far off the unseen horse neighed again. It was
growing darker, but all around the scarlet tunics of the
guards were as red as blood.</p>

<p>Then the answer came. The twisted lips of the tormentor
moved slowly, and words came from them in a
thin, harsh voice, like the creaking of the rack.</p>

<p>'She is Michael Rhangabé's daughter.'</p>

<p>'The Protosparthos?' The Emperor's voice shook
again.</p>

<p>The corpse-faced man nodded twice in assent, and his
thin lips writhed hideously when Zoë's eyes fell on
him.</p>

<p>'I saw her at the prison when I took him out to die,'
he said.</p>

<p>His bony hand, all knotty and stained from his horrid
work, took the girl's delicate chin, forcing her to turn
her full face to him; and she quivered from head to foot
at his touch. He knew well the convulsive shiver that
ran through the victim he touched for the first time;
he could feel it in his fingers as the musician feels the
strings; he was familiar with it, as the fisherman's hand
is with the tremor and tension of his rod when a fish
strikes; and he smiled in a ghastly way.</p>

<p>'Yes,' he said, 'it is she.' And he laughed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>

<p>He held her by the chin and wagged her beautiful
head to right and left.</p>

<p>Since the Emperor had spoken no sound had been
heard but the torturer's discordant voice; but now the
outraged girl's shriek of fury split the air.</p>

<p>'Wretch!'</p>

<p>Her small hands suddenly slipped through the Ethiopian's
capacious hold. Before he could catch her she
had wrenched herself free from both men and had struck
a furious blow full in the torturer's livid face; and
though she was but a slender girl her anger gave her a
man's strength, and her swiftness lent her a sudden
advantage. The man reeled back three paces before he
could steady himself again.</p>

<p>'Hold her!' cried Andronicus, for he feared she might
have a knife hidden on her, and both her hands were free.</p>

<p>But only for that instant. Though the African was
huge, he was quick, and he was behind her. Almost
before the Emperor had called out, Zoë was a prisoner
again, and the man she had struck was close to her with
his battered leathern bag. He looked up to Andronicus
for a command before he began his work.</p>

<p>'Make her tell what she knows,' the Emperor said,
reassured since she was again fast in the African's great
hands.</p>

<p>He leaned forward a little, the better to hear the words
which pain was to draw from Zoë's lips, and the Greek
minister settled himself comfortably in the saddle to
enjoy the rare amusement of seeing a beautiful and noble
girl deliberately tortured before half a hundred men.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
Some of the guards also pressed upon each other to see;
but there were some among them who had served under
Rhangabé, and these looked into one another's faces
and spoke words almost under their breath, that all
together swelled to a low murmur, such as the tide
makes on a still night, just when it turns back from the
ebb.</p>

<p>The sunset had faded, but there was light enough to
see the dark bruise across the corpse-like face where Zoë
had struck it with all her might.</p>

<p>The man opened his old leathern bag, and his stained
hands fumbled in it, amongst irons that were brown but
not rusty, and thongs plaited with wire, and strangely
shaped tools in which there were well-greased screws
that turned easily.</p>

<p>But all these his knotty fingers rejected. He knew
each by the touch. They were good enough for ordinary
slaves, or perhaps for a double-dealing steward, or even
a lying courtier. For a highborn maiden victim he had
an instrument far more refined and exquisitely keen
than any of these things, and he treasured it as a very
rare possession which never left him day or night; for
it had been sent to him from very far away in the south
as a present of great value; and it was alive, and needed
the warmth of his body constantly lest it should die.
But there was something in the bag that belonged to it
and must be found before it could be taken from its little
cage of silver filigree in the bosom of the corpse-faced
man.</p>

<p>He found it. His stained hand drew from the bag a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
dry walnut. With the point of the knife he wore at his
belt he split it carefully, and turned the nut out of one of
the half shells, tossing the other into the bag.</p>

<p>The Greek minister watched him with the deepest
interest, but Andronicus drummed impatiently with his
gloved fingers on the high gilt pommel of his saddle.
Yet it was all very quickly done, and though there was
less light there was still enough; and while he waited
the Emperor again read the letter Zoë had dropped.</p>

<p>But she watched him, calm and fearless, and ready to
face death if need be; she wondered what sort of hold
Carlo Zeno would take on his neck, when all was known.
And she saw red all round him and behind him and beside
him up to his knees, the red of the guards' tunics that
were like scarlet stains in the twilight air.</p>

<p>Once more the restless horse neighed, far off, and
another answered him.</p>

<p>Then the man was ready. He took his knife and
ripped Zoë's blue cotton tunic from her throat to her
left shoulder and down her side, and she tried not even
to shudder, for she did not know what was coming but
she would die bravely; and when she was dead Zeno
would come, and Gorlias, and they would avenge her.
Death was but death, even by torture, and there were
worse things in life which had been spared her.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if she died, it would be for a good cause,
as well as to help Zeno to be free. Therefore, now that
it was all decided, she looked a last time at the face of
Andronicus, loose-lipped and cruel, and then shut her
eyes and prayed God that she might neither flinch nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
utter one word that could hinder the end, if it was at
hand, as she still hoped.</p>

<p>She felt the chilly air on her shoulder and side, and
then something small and hard was pressed against her,
just under her arm; and hands that felt like horns,
but were horribly quick and skilful, put a bandage
round her and drew it tight, and it kept the thing in
its place.</p>

<p>But under that thing, which was the half walnut
shell, something small was alive and moved slowly round
and round. There was no real pain at first, but she felt
that the slow and delicate irritation might drive her mad.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, a thrill of wild agony ran through her
and convulsed her body against her will, but many
hands held her now and she could not move. The horrible
borer-beetle had begun to work its way into her
flesh, under the walnut shell.</p>

<p>The corpse-faced man had watched her attentively,
and when he saw her start his creaking voice was heard
in the stillness.</p>

<p>'She will speak before you can count ten score,' he
said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p>Zoë had closed her eyes to bear the pain better,
and a tiny drop of blood slowly trickled from the
lip she had bitten in the first moment of the
torture. It made a thin, dark line from her mouth
downward, a little on the left side, over her white chin.
Her breath came in deep and quivering sobs, drawn
through her clenched teeth, but no other sound escaped
her in those awful seconds. She was praying that death
might come soon, but she did not ask for strength to be
silent; that she had, for Carlo Zeno's sake, and for the
sake of the just vengeance that would overtake Andronicus
when she was dead, if only he were not warned of
what was perhaps so near. She thought she might
die of the pain only; she was sure that she must faint
away if it lasted many moments longer.</p>

<p>The Emperor bent down in his saddle to see her agonised
white face more clearly in the gathering gloom, and to
catch the least syllable she might speak; and his loose
lip moved, for he was counting to himself, counting the
ten score, after which she would be able to bear no
more and would tell him where the danger was. For
the corpse-faced man knew his business, and his experience
had been wide and long, and the Emperor knew
that he never made a mistake. Moreover, the Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
minister smiled with sheer pleasure at the sight, and
hoped that his master would command them to put the
girl to death by very slow torments.</p>

<p>The guards, too, crowded upon each other to see, but
they were not all silent now; for there were brave men
amongst them, savage adventurers from the wild mountains
beyond the Black Sea, who feared neither God,
nor Emperor, nor man; and they did not like the sight
they saw, and they said words one to another in strange
tongues which the Greeks could not understand.</p>

<p>Andronicus counted slowly to twenty, and then still
more slowly to forty, and the tortured girl's sharp breathing
irritated him.</p>

<p>'Speak!' he cried, in a tone that was low and angry.
'Tell me where the danger is, or the thing shall eat out
your heart!'</p>

<p>Then the answer came, but not in Zoë's voice, nor by
one voice, but by many, loud and deep; and though the
words were confused, some could be heard well enough;
and they told the loose-lipped cowardly youth where
the danger was, for it was upon him.</p>

<p>'Johannes! Johannes reigns! God and the Emperor!
Emperor Johannes!'</p>

<p>That was what the voices shouted from the gate, as
the multitude swept in, driving the sentinels and guards
before them as the gale drives dry leaves. With but one
breathing-space for thought and resolve, the guards in
their scarlet tunics closed round Andronicus like waves
of blood in the deep dusk, and he went down under them,
and heard them answer the coming people&mdash;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span></p>

<p>'Johannes reigns! Emperor Johannes!'</p>

<p>Zoë heard the cry through her torment and forgot
the pain for one moment, and the next, the dumb
Ethiopian who had held her, slit the torturer's bandage
and plucked the walnut shell from under her arm,
with its living contents, and threw them away; for he
had seen Andronicus go down, and knew that there was
a new master. Then some of the men, who remembered
it afterwards, saw the corpse-faced man grovelling on the
ground and searching for his treasure, which could make
the toughest victim speak before one could count ten
score; for he served the Emperor, whoever he might be,
as he and his father before him had served many. No
one ever killed the torturer. So he went amongst the
trampling feet on his hands and knees, feeling nothing, if
so be that he might find his pet and get it back safely
into its cage in his bosom. And when he found it still
in the walnut shell, by the strange chance that protects
all evil, he laughed like a maniac and slipped between
the guards' legs on all fours, like a hideous white-faced
ape, and ran away into the palace.</p>

<p>Zoë had opened her eyes, and the pain was gone,
leaving only a throb behind, and she gathered her torn
tunic to her neck with one hand as best she could and
slipped out of the turmoil; and only she, of all those that
heard the first shout, knew how it was that the people
were cheering for the delivered Emperor, while Johannes
was still shut up in the tower and guarded by the deaf-and-dumb
Africans; and in the glorious triumph of
her plan she forgot everything else but the man she loved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
and he was safe now, beyond all doubt. Was he not the
friend of the restored Johannes? The soldiers would
not dare, on their lives, to keep him a prisoner now, not
for one hour, not for one moment.</p>

<p>And there he rode, surely enough, in the front rank
of the multitude, on the right hand of Emperor John.
She knew him, though the last grey light was fading from
the sky. She would have known him in the dark, it
seemed to her that if she had been blind she would have
known that he was near; and her joy rose in her throat,
after the torture she had endured, and almost choked
her, so that she reeled unsteadily and gasped for breath.</p>

<p>He was on the right hand of the Emperor John, 'Handsome
John,' whom the people had once loved and whom
they were now ready to love again, having tasted of the
scorpions with which Andronicus had regaled them.
'Handsome John,' with his splendid brown beard&mdash;the
light of torches flashed upon it now&mdash;and his cloth-of-gold
cloak drawn closely round him like a bishop's
cope, so that it hid his hands and half his bridle on each
side, and covered the back of his head, too, and a great
part of his cheeks; he wore the tall imperial head-dress
also, and it shaded his eyes. The people had recognised
him more by his fine beard and his cloth of gold than by
his face, but the beard was unmistakable; and besides,
there were men with him who scattered coins to the multitude,
and those coins were good. But the followers
who were nearest to him and Zeno, and who pressed round
them both to defend them, if need be, were almost all
sailors, Venetian shipwrights and workmen from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
docks, though Tocktamish's Tartars were close behind,
making a tremendous shouting, and striking their long
tasselled spears against each other after their manner,
with a clatter of wood like a monstrous rattle; and other
soldiers had joined them by hundreds, and after them
pressed the artisans of Constantinople, the Bulgarian
blacksmiths, the Italian stone-cutters and masons, the
Moorish armourers and the Syrian sword-smiths from
Damascus, the Sicilian rope-makers, the Persian silk-weavers,
and the Smyrniote carpet-weavers, and the
linen-weavers from Alexandria with many others; and
every man who was not a soldier had something in his
hand for a weapon&mdash;a hammer, a mallet, or a carpet-maker's
staff, or only a stout cudgel. And they ran,
and pushed, and forced their way through the gate,
spreading out again within the court, cheering and yelling
for Johannes in a dozen languages at once.</p>

<p>The Emperor John sat quite still on his horse, wrapped
in his cloak, but Zeno rode forward, till he was almost
upon the knot of the guards who had pulled down
Andronicus, and he threw up his hand, crying out to the
men not to kill, in a voice that dominated the terrific din;
and he was but just in time, for he was only obeyed because
he offered a reward.</p>

<p>'Ten pounds of gold for Andronicus alive!' he shouted.</p>

<p>For that was the price Andronicus had set on his head
that morning, and what was enough for Zeno was enough
for an Emperor. So half a dozen of the guards dragged
the man alive into the palace, and bound him securely
with his hands behind him, and stripped off his jewels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
and his gold, and kicked him into a small secret room
behind the porter's lodge, and shut the door. There the
corpse-faced man was squatting in a dark corner, blowing
some coals to a glow in an earthen pan, because he
might soon be called to do more work, and unless the
vinegar was really boiling hot the fumes of it would not
put out the eyesight. As Andronicus lay on the floor
he could see the man.</p>

<p>But outside, the confusion grew and the noise increased
as the people poured into the vast courtyard and pressed
behind upon those who had entered before them.</p>

<p>Then the door of the tower in the corner was opened
from within, and the African mutes came out and joined
the other soldiers, and from an upper window the captain
and his wife looked down, and by the help of what
she told him he understood that it was time to set his
prisoner free, if he did not mean to risk being torn to
shreds by the people, though he could not at all understand
who it was whom he saw on horseback in the
torchlight, dressed in cloth of gold, with the imperial
head-dress on his head, for he knew well enough that so
long as the key of the upper prison hung at his own belt,
Johannes could not get out. Yet there was no mistaking
the cry of the people, and his wife urged him not to lose
time.</p>

<p>The crowd was surging towards the tower now, led
by Zeno and the Emperor, and they and their sailors
and dockmen kept in front of the crowd to be the first
to dismount and enter the tower, and then the sailors
kept the throng back, telling them that Johannes had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
gone in to free his youngest son, and the two men who
had the deep bags of money threw lavish handfuls to
the people, to amuse them while they waited.</p>

<p>But when Zeno and the Emperor came out again,
Johannes' face was all uncovered, and the cloth-of-gold
cope hung loosely on his shoulders; and by the glare of
many torches every one knew that it was Johannes himself,
and none other, and men cheered and yelled till they
were hoarse.</p>

<p>After the Emperor and Zeno came a man whom no
one had seen go in with them, and he had a very scanty
dark beard and was dressed in quiet brown, though he
wore a horseman's boots, and he was Gorlias Pietrogliant,
who had acted so well the part which Zoë had imagined
for him.</p>

<p>But Zeno knew nothing of Arethusa, yesterday his
slave, and since last night the woman of his heart, for
in the haste and stress of that tremendous half-hour,
Gorlias could tell him nothing, except that he was
Gorlias and not the Emperor, and that the deed giving
Tenedos over to Venice was signed and in his bosom;
and Zeno supposed that he had devised all the wonderful
scheme, which looked so simple as soon as it began to be
carried out. Arethusa, he thought, was safe at home;
sleepless, worn out with waiting, trembling with anxiety,
perhaps, but safe. Now that the deed was done, now
that Andronicus was bound, and Johannes, his father, was
restored to the throne, Carlo Zeno thought only of leaving
Constantinople without delay, before the Emperor could
take back his word, and revoke the cession of Tenedos.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
For Zeno did not put his trust in Oriental princes, and
feared the Greeks even when they offered gifts. With a
swift Venetian vessel and a fair wind, the coveted island
could be reached in two days, or even less; its governor
had always at heart been faithful to Johannes, and
would obey the deed which Gorlias had thrust into
Zeno's hand in the tower, and if once the standard of
St. Mark were raised on the fort there was small chance
that any enemy would be able to tear it down.</p>

<p>Therefore, just when the soldiers were lifting Johannes
from his horse to carry him to the throne-room with wild
triumph and rejoicing, Zeno slipped from the saddle to
escape notice, elbowed his way to the outskirts of the
crowd, and was on the point of making for the gate when
Gorlias found him again.</p>

<p>'Arethusa asks you to come to her,' Gorlias said.</p>

<p>'I am going&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No. She is here. It was all her plan; she risked her
life for it, we were a few moments late, and she has been
tortured. Come quickly!'</p>

<p>Zeno's face changed. Gorlias saw that, even in the
dim light of the now distant torches. It was the change
that comes into a master swordman's face when he makes
up his mind to kill, after only defending himself because
his adversary has tried some dastardly murderous trick
of fence. But Zeno said nothing as he strode swiftly
by his companion's side.</p>

<p>Gorlias had found her and had brought her into the
lower chamber of the tower, now deserted by the guards.
The captain's wife had been standing at the door, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
daring to go out amongst the half-frantic soldiers. She
might have fared ill at their hands if she had been
recognised just then as the wife of the Emperor's gaoler.
So she had stood under the archway, watching and listening,
and Gorlias had given Zoë half-fainting into her care
while he went to find Zeno.</p>

<p>She had taken the girl on her knees like a child, while
she herself sat on the narrow stone bench that ran round
the wall, for there was no furniture of any sort there.
Zoë's head lay upon the shoulder of the big woman who
gently smoothed and patted the soft brown hair, and
rocked the light figure on her knees with a side motion
as nurses do. She did not know what was the matter,
but she recognised the girl who had brought the message
and who had been caught outside the door.</p>

<p>Then Zeno came, and in a moment he was close beside
Zoë; resting one knee on the stone bench, bending down,
and very tenderly lifting the lovely head into his own arm.</p>

<p>She knew his touch, she turned her face up with a great
effort, for she had hardly any strength left, and her lids
that were but half-closed like a dying person's, quivered
and opened, and for one instant her eyes were full of
light. Her voice came to him from far off, almost from
the other world.</p>

<p>'Safe! Ah, thank God! It was worth the pain!'</p>

<p>Then she fainted quite away in his arms, but he knew
that she was not dying, for he had seen many pass
from life, and the signs were familiar to him.</p>

<p>He gathered her to him and carried her lightly through
the open door, where Gorlias was ready; and Gorlias
knew where Vito was waiting with the skiff at the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
landing not far below the tower, and he helped the boatman
to row them home.</p>

<p>Thus ended that long day, which had so nearly been
Zoë's last and Zeno's too; and when she opened her eyes
again and found herself lying on her own divan under
the soft light of the lamps, and looked into his anxious,
loving face, all the weariness sank away from her own,
and for an instant she felt as strong as if she had freshly
waked from rest; then she put up her arms together,
though it hurt her very much to lift the left one, and she
clasped her hands round his handsome brown neck and
drew him down to her without a word.</p>

<p>It was only for a moment. Her strength failed her
again, and he felt her little hands relax; so he knelt
down by the divan and laid his cheek upon the edge of
her pillow, so that he could look into her face, and they
both smiled; and his smile was anxious, but hers was
satisfied. He did not know what they had done to her,
but he was sure that she needed care.</p>

<p>'You are suffering,' he said. 'What shall I do?
Shall I send for a physician?'</p>

<p>'No. Stay with me. Let me look at you. That is
all I need.'</p>

<p>Her speech came in short, soft phrases, like kisses from
lips half-asleep, when there is a little dream between each
sentence and the next. But even when she was asleep
he still knelt beside her, and now and then her body
quivered, and she drew a sharp breath suddenly as if
the pain she had borne ran through her again, though
more in memory than in real suffering now.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p>Zeno left her when she was breathing quietly,
after ordering the two little maids to watch her by
turns, or at least to go to sleep very near her, in
case she should wake and call. He himself was worn
out with fatigue and hunger, for he had not tasted anything
since he had supped with Zoë on the previous
evening. He went down to his own rooms, where Vito
had prepared him food and wine, which he had asked
Gorlias to share with him. But the ex-astrologer was
gone, and the master ate and drank alone that night,
smiling now and then at the recollection of the dark hours
in the dry cistern, and giving orders to Vito about the
journey which was to be begun on the morrow, if possible.
And Vito gave him a detailed account of what
had happened in his absence.</p>

<p>Now that Zoë was safe he was supremely happy. In
his heart the fighting man had detested the peaceful
merchant's life he had chosen to lead for more than two
years, and already, in imagination, his hands were on
the helm, the salt spray was in his face, and his ship was
going free on her course for the wonderful Isles of Adventure.</p>

<p>But by the orders he gave while he ate his supper,
Vito understood that he was not going alone. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
had Carlo Zeno ever taken rich carpets, soft cushions,
silver basins, and delicate provisions to sea with him,
except as merchandise, packed in bales and stowed
below? A camp-bed ashore, a hammock at sea, were
enough for his comfort. Vito mentally noted each order,
and when the time came he had forgotten nothing;
but he asked no questions.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, when Zeno had learned that
Zoë was still asleep, he went down to the harbour and
found that Sebastian Cornèr's ship was to sail the next
day at dawn, the same vessel that had brought the letter
from Venice which had led him to buy Arethusa; the
very galley by which she should have been carried to
Marco Pesaro, if Zeno had not thought better of the
matter before drawing the three hundred ducats.</p>

<p>Now Sebastian Cornèr was a brave captain, as well as
a man of business, and could be trusted; and when Zeno
had shown him the deed which gave Tenedos to the
Serene Republic he did not hesitate, but promised to
help Carlo to take possession of the island within three
days, before Johannes could change his mind. So that
matter was settled, and Zeno departed, saying that he
would send his baggage on board during the day.</p>

<p>When he came home he found the secretary waiting
with his tale of woe. Omobono looked and felt like an
elderly sick lamb, very sorry for himself and terribly
anxious not to be blamed for what had happened,
while equally afraid of being scolded for talking too
much. He had passed through the most awful ordeal of
his peaceful life very bravely, he believed; and if Zeno
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
had called him a cackling hen that morning the shock
might have unsettled his brain, and would certainly have
broken his heart.</p>

<p>But Zeno had been informed by Vito of the events
that had disturbed his household, and knew that Omobono
had done his best, considering what his worst
might have been, he being of a timid temperament.</p>

<p>'You did very well,' said the master. 'In ancient days,
Omobono, those who died for their faith were indeed
venerated as martyrs, but those who suffered and lived
were afterwards revered as confessors. That is your
position.'</p>

<p>This piece of information Zeno had acquired, with more
of the same kind, when he had expected to be made
a canon of Patras. Omobono's heart glowed at the
praise.</p>

<p>'And the confessor, sir, has the advantage of being
alive and can still be useful,' he ventured to suggest,
though with some diffidence.</p>

<p>'Precisely,' Zeno assented. 'A live dog is better than
a dead lion. I mean a watch-dog, of course, Omobono,'
he added rather hastily, 'a faithful watch-dog.'</p>

<p>Omobono's appearance that morning did not suggest
the guardian of the flock, the shepherd's shaggy friend.
Not in the least; but he was pleased, and when he was
told that he was to pack his belongings and make
ready to leave Constantinople for a trip to Venice his
delight actually brought a little colour into his grey
cheeks.</p>

<p>'And may I enquire, sir,' he began, 'about the&mdash;&mdash;'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
he paused and looked significantly at the ceiling, to indicate
the upper story of the house,&mdash;'about the lady?'
he added, finishing his question at last.</p>

<p>'She goes with us,' answered Zeno briefly.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. But may I ask whether it will be part of
my duty to be responsible for her?'</p>

<p>'You?' Zeno looked at the little man in undisguised
astonishment.</p>

<p>'I mean, sir, on Messer Marco Pesaro's account. I had
understood&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'No,' said Zeno, 'you had not understood.'</p>

<p>'But then, sir&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Omobono, I have often warned you against your
curiosity.'</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. I pray every day for strength to withstand
it. Nevertheless, though I know it is a sin it sometimes
leads me to learn things which are of use. I do not
think that if you knew what I know, sir, you would
contemplate the possibility of disposing of&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'You talk too much,' said Zeno. 'If you have anything
to say, then say it. If you have nothing to say,
then say nothing. But do not talk. What have you
found out?'</p>

<p>Thus deprived of the pleasure of telling a long story,
Omobono conscientiously tried to impart his information
in the fewest possible words.</p>

<p>'The lady is not called Arethusa, sir. Before she sold
herself to Rustan to save her people from starvation
she was called Zoë Rhangabé, the daughter of the Protosparthos
who was executed by Andronicus&mdash;&mdash;'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span></p>

<p>'Rhangabé?' repeated Zeno, not believing him; for
it was a great name, and is still.</p>

<p>'Yes, sir. But that was not her name, either,
for he and his wife had adopted her because they
had no children, but afterwards two boys were born
to them&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Confound their boys!' interrupted Zeno. 'Who is
she?'</p>

<p>'Her real name is Bianca Giustiniani; she is a Venetian
by birth, and her father and mother died of the
plague here soon after she was born. You see, sir,
under the circumstances, and although the lady called
herself a slave, such a commission as Messer Marco
Pesaro's&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Omobono,' said Zeno, interrupting him again, 'get a
priest here at once. I am going to be married.'</p>

<p>'Married, sir?' The little secretary was aghast.</p>

<p>And before Omobono could say more, Zeno had left
the room.</p>

<p>He found Zoë standing by the open window, and the
morning sun was still streaming in. Her hair was not
taken up yet, but lay like silk all over her shoulders,
still damp from the bath. She was a little pale, as a
flower that has blossomed in a dark room, and the rough
white silk of the robe she drew closely round her showed
by contrast the delicate tint and texture of her skin,
and the sweet freshness of the tender and spiritual
mouth.</p>

<p>He took her hand and looked at her earnestly before he

spoke. Only a night, a day and a night, had passed since
he had understood what had hidden itself in his heart
for weeks. That same truth had stolen into hers, too, but
she had known what it meant.</p>

<p>'You kept your secret well,' he said&mdash;'too well!'</p>

<p>She shook her head, thinking he spoke of her
love.</p>

<p>'You knew it long ago,' she answered. 'And what
you did not know, you guessed. You kept yours better
far.'</p>

<p>'I kept that one from myself, as best I could,' said he,
understanding what she meant. 'I could not keep it
for ever! But since we know that we love, our life
begins here, and together. Together, because you saved
mine&mdash;I know everything, for they have told me; and
so my life is yours, and yours is mine, because we were
born to mate, as falcons mate with falcons, doves with
doves, and song-birds with song-birds.'</p>

<p>'Say falcons!' laughed Zoë. 'I like the brave bird
better!'</p>

<p>'I do, too,&mdash;and so my little falcon, Arethusa, we
must wing it together to a safer nest before Tocktamish
or some other barbarian stirs up a counter-revolution.
Will you come with me?'</p>

<p>She smiled and laid her hand in his.</p>

<p>'Am I not your bought slave?' she asked. 'I must
obey.'</p>

<p>'That is not enough. We are Christian man and
maid. You shall go with me in honour to my own
people.'

<p>'A gentleman of Venice cannot marry a slave,' she
objected, though she smiled.</p>

<p>He laughed, happily, and drew back from her a little.</p>

<p>'A gentleman of Venice may do what seems good in
his own eyes, if it be not treason,' he said. 'I publish
the banns of marriage between Messer Carlo Zeno, of
Venice, bachelor, and Arethusa&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Of Rustan Karaboghazji's slave market, spinster!'
suggested Zoë, laughing with him. 'It is a noble alliance
for the great Doge's house, sir!'</p>

<p>'Oh! You talk of Doges? Then I will put it in
another way, as the priest will say it presently, for I
think he is waiting downstairs by this time, and Omobono
is teaching him his lesson.'</p>

<p>'How shall you put it?'</p>

<p>'Bianca Giustiniani, wilt thou take this man to be thy
wedded husband?'</p>

<p>She was taken by surprise, and for a moment the words
would not come.</p>

<p>'Wilt thou take this man?' he asked again, but more
softly now, and nearer to her lips, though he did not see
them; for he thought he saw her soul in her brave
brown eyes, and as for her answer, he knew it.</p>

<p>Now the rest of Zeno's life, with much of what the
story-teller has told here, is extant in very bad Latin,
written by one of his grandsons, the good bishop Jacopo
Zeno of Belluno: how he sailed down the Dardanelles,
and made good the Emperor John's gift of Tenedos to
the Republic; and how the Genoese tried hard to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
it from him; and how he fought like the hero he was, with
a handful of men against a host, and drove them off
and saved the island; and also how he lived to save
Venice herself from them when all seemed lost, and broke
their power for ever afterwards; and how he did many
other glorious and great things, all after he had taken
Bianca Giustiniani to wife.</p>
